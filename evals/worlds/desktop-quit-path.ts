 * happens in the field: `kill <pid>` (SIGTERM to the main process only, the
 * eval-host cleanup and supervisor path) and Chromium's own `Browser.close`
 * (the Cmd+Q / Quit-menu path without touching any other instance of the app on
 * this machine). Two install states cover the teardown that runs on each: a
 * fresh install that never activated has no runtime to stop, so its
 * `before-quit` teardown settles without leaving the microtask queue; an
 * activated install stops a real local server first.
 *
 * `desktop()` cannot be used because its readiness probe only recognises
 * signed-in surfaces, so launches attach directly.
