# Acme Web

Seeded Acme Den, the Harness web app, a managed OpenCode engine, and the real
`ee/apps/gateway` service. Only the Anthropic-compatible upstream is simulated;
it returns **Acme AI Gateway is working.** No paid model credentials or LiteLLM
are required.

## Start

Use a checkout with dependencies installed in both the repository and `evals`.
The co-located runtime needs MySQL, Redis, Node, pnpm, and OpenCode. Prepare the
shared packages once:

```sh
pnpm --filter @harness/types build
pnpm --filter @harness-ee/den-db build
pnpm --filter @harness/email build
pnpm world up acme-web --place local --stage gateway-demo --detach --timeout 600000
pnpm world outputs acme-web --stage gateway-demo
```

The world owns a scratch database and an isolated OpenCode workspace. Den and
Gateway share that database and encryption key. Provider creation, member-key
issuance, model aliases, managed provider sync, gateway authorization, native
protocol forwarding, and usage accounting use the product implementations.

Startup completes only after a real OpenCode chat returns the deterministic
reply through the gateway. The verification conversation is retained for
inspection. This is runtime-path verification, not proof of browser sign-in.

Open `webUrl`, sign in to `denWeb` as `alex@acme.test`, and select **Acme AI
Gateway / Claude Haiku 4.5**. Retrieve the fixture password privately:

```sh
pnpm world outputs acme-web --stage gateway-demo --reveal
```

Send a message and expect the fixed reply. Reload or switch workspaces to
inspect the composer model title; the `gwm_*` routing alias must not flash as
the label. Gateway access can be managed in Den's AI Gateway screen.

## Automated regression

```sh
pnpm evals:pr specs/acme-web-gateway.test.ts
```

This cold-boots the same composition and verifies:

- the real Den inventory creates an `ipr_*` provider and `gwm_*` model alias;
- the human-readable model name reaches the managed OpenCode runtime;
- upstream credentials do not appear in runtime provider configuration;
- an OpenCode chat reaches the real gateway and authenticated upstream;
- request accounting records the organization, alias, upstream model, tokens,
  and a positive cost;
- invalid gateway keys and revoked access grants cannot reach the upstream.

Run one Den-web world/test per worktree because Next.js holds a worktree-local
development lock. Stop the preview before running the cold-boot regression.
Tests can import `bootAcmeWeb` and `probeAcmeGateway` and own teardown with an
`AsyncDisposableStack`.

```sh
pnpm world down acme-web --stage gateway-demo
```

This world runs co-located (`--place local`) or inside a private Freestyle VM.
Host-driven `--place daytona` provisioning is not implemented. It exercises organization AI Gateway providers, not the separate
Harness Models subscription/credit-billing flow.

## Private Freestyle review

The reviewer can launch **ACME web · Full stack** from the report's exact commit.
CI starts and seeds the whole world, enables AI Gateway in the owner sidebar,
verifies an OpenCode request through the gateway, and warms browser entry points
before capturing the running memory snapshot. Each clone resumes those processes
with independent database and file state; it does not reseed or restart them.
The private edge maps the snapshot’s virtual origins to each clone’s unique URLs,
including in Den’s own OAuth requests, so OAuth MCP servers connect from each clone.
Launch checks restored services and renews expired demo sessions when necessary.
The model upstream alone is deterministic. This is an isolated demo, not production
accounts or billing. Initial preparation can take several minutes.

```sh
pnpm world up acme-web --place freestyle --detach --timeout 800000 -- --ref <full-pushed-sha>
pnpm world outputs acme-web --reveal
pnpm world down acme-web
```

The private review shows personal service URLs and demo sign-in credentials by
default. Developer tokens and connections expand below. Copying always returns
usable values; Hide credentials is available for screen sharing. Each HTTP service
has its own access link; API clients can use the preview cookie plus the service's
bearer token. MySQL and Redis addresses are VM-local, not publicly reachable.
Freestyle account credentials never appear in world outputs. All connections expire
with the VM.

## Daytona

```sh
HARNESS_EVAL_REF=$(git rev-parse HEAD) pnpm world up acme-web --place daytona --stage gateway-demo --detach --timeout 1500000
pnpm world outputs acme-web --stage gateway-demo --reveal
```

Push the commit first; the sandboxes build that ref. Den provisioning starts
the real `ee/apps/gateway` beside Den when Den env sets `GATEWAY_ENABLED=true`,
and the deterministic upstream (`evals/packages/labs/src/acme-upstream.mjs`)
is uploaded into the same sandbox so gateway → upstream stays on loopback.
Startup completes only after one message through the public gateway URL
returns the fixed reply. The Harness web runtime runs on its own private
sandbox proxying this Den, and the launcher signs it into Den as alex so every
AI Gateway provider, including ones added later in Den, reaches the model
picker after a reload. `aiGateway` links to the AI Providers tab.
