/**
 * Open-then-verify access to files under the workspace, shared by the plugins
 * that read attachments or read and write workbooks.
 *
 * Node exposes neither openat nor O_RESOLVE_BENEATH, so any pathname is
 * resolved again by every syscall and a directory under the workspace could
 * be swapped for a link between two of them. These helpers therefore never
 * decide anything from a pathname check that precedes a syscall. They obtain
 * the file handle FIRST, then prove — from the handle's own inode — that it
 * is the regular file sitting at exactly the requested path inside the real
 * workspace root, with no symbolic link in any component and a real directory
 * as its parent. Only a handle that passes is ever read from or written to.
 *
 * The one pathname-dependent effect that can survive a concurrent swap is the
 * exclusive creation of an EMPTY file: O_EXCL can never replace an existing
 * file, no content is written before the proof passes, callers restrict the
 * name to an inert extension, and a misplaced empty inode is removed by
 * identity. Overwrites open without O_CREAT and without O_TRUNC, so nothing
 * changes until the handle is proven to be the very inode the caller decided
 * to overwrite.
