# Harness EE Helm Chart

Initial Helm chart for the Harness EE Den stack:

- `den-api` control plane on port `8788`
- `den-web` web app on port `3005`
- optional Harness Gateway service on port `8791` (`gateway.enabled`)

Gateway retains the chart's legacy `inference.*` aliases, secret keys, image
repository, resource names and selectors for upgrade safety. Only explicit
`gateway.enabled: true` advertises the new capability; legacy service enablement
alone does not. Gateway here means `ee/apps/gateway`, not the separate
`den-gateway` web edge application.
See [Gateway configuration and stable contracts](../../../ee/apps/gateway/README.md).
- shared ConfigMap and Secret templating
- optional Ingress for web and API hosts
- pre-install/pre-upgrade migration Job scaffold

## Gateway Compatibility (Chart 0.2.0)

`gateway: {}` is intentionally sparse, with **no canonical defaults** that could
mask an existing `inference.enabled: true`. An absent root (including old
`--reuse-values` releases) is treated as `{}`; an explicitly supplied non-map is
rejected. Supported structural overrides are
`enabled`, `replicaCount`, `image`, `service`, `containerPort`, `env`,
`podAnnotations`, `podLabels`, `resources`, `probes`, and `retention`.

| Configuration | Service | `GATEWAY_ENABLED` in Den API / Gateway |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defaults | Absent | `false` / absent |
| `inference.enabled: true`, no canonical enablement | Retained | `false` / `false` |
| `gateway.enabled: false`, even with legacy true | Absent | `false` / absent |
| `gateway.enabled: true` with valid configuration | Present | `true` / `true` |

For every structural key, canonical **presence** wins, not truthiness. Nonempty
maps merge recursively; `{}`, `[]`, `false`, `0`, and `""` replace the inherited
value. For example, `gateway.env: {}` clears all inherited env overrides,
`gateway.service.annotations: {}` clears legacy annotations, and
`gateway.replicaCount: 0` scales down without disabling capability intent.
`gateway.probes: {}` removes both probes. Clearing a required field (such as
`gateway.image: {}` or service port `0`) fails with a configuration error when
the service is enabled. An empty image **tag** clears a legacy tag and uses
`image.tag`, then `Chart.appVersion`, for both the Deployment and retention job.
These clear semantics apply to the canonical-over-legacy merge **after Helm has
coalesced its values**. They work when migrating reused legacy `inference.*`
configuration: for example, a new `gateway.env: {}` clears old `inference.env`.
The root `gateway: {}` itself means no overrides, not removal of the legacy service.

Helm can refill an empty map with saved **canonical** values before any chart
template runs. After a release has saved `gateway.env.SAVED`, a later
`--reuse-values --set-json 'gateway.env={}'` retains that entry; the chart cannot
recover the original empty-map intent. The same limitation applies to nested
maps from earlier values files. To clear previously canonical maps, use
`--reset-values` with a complete, reviewed values file that omits the old entries
and explicitly includes the desired empty maps. Preserve all other deployment
configuration and Secret references in that file. Do not rely on a final empty
override file or `--reset-then-reuse-values` to discard saved maps. `null` is
Helm's deletion operator, not a supported chart clear value here.

The `*-inference` Service, Deployment, container name, selectors and default
`ghcr.io/vaishnavjai/harness-inference` repository are unchanged. Existing Den
web/API ingress hosts and resource names are untouched. This chart does not
create Gateway ingress automatically: provision a desktop-reachable TLS endpoint
using your existing ingress/mesh or `gateway.service` load balancer settings.

Explicit enablement with an existing Secret:

```yaml
gateway:
  enabled: true
config:
  internal:
    gatewayProxyBaseUrl: http://harness-ee-inference:8791
    inferenceProxyBaseUrl: https://existing-models.example.com # Keep your existing Models endpoint.
  public:
    gatewayPublicBaseUrl: https://gateway.example.com
secret:
  create: false
  existingSecret: harness-ee-secrets
```

Set the internal hostname to your release's retained Service name. Both URLs
must be explicit origins without credentials, non-root paths, queries, or
fragments. Public origins must use HTTPS and a qualified, non-local hostname;
internal origins may use HTTP. Loopback origins are rejected. A trailing `/`
is permitted. Helm performs static validation; the application's shared Gateway
environment parser performs final URL, database and encryption validation at
startup. Rendering cannot verify DNS, TLS, Secret contents, or reachability.

`config.internal.gatewayProxyBaseUrl` overrides legacy
`config.internal.inferenceProxyBaseUrl` **by presence**, including `""`. An empty
canonical URL clears the legacy one and fails validation if Gateway is enabled.
Without the canonical key, an explicitly configured legacy URL satisfies the
internal origin requirement. The generated in-cluster URL remains available for
legacy service-only installations, but is not sufficient for new opt-in.
`config.public.gatewayPublicBaseUrl` has no inferred public fallback. Legacy
Models retain a valid desktop origin from `INFERENCE_PROXY_BASE_URL`, otherwise
use the configured public Gateway origin, never its internal Service address.
When a canonical proxy or public destination is configured, Helm emits the nonempty existing `config.internal.inferenceProxyBaseUrl`
as that legacy variable, or the public origin if unset/empty; keep your existing
Models endpoint in this legacy setting despite its `internal` name. Gateway's
canonical internal URL still wins for internal resolution, including empty clears.
Public destinations survive management disable: runtime Models selection prefers a
valid legacy Models public origin, then a valid Gateway public origin, regardless
of the flag. The chart retains shared public configuration on disabled deployments;
existing per-app public URL overrides remain honored there. Without a usable public
destination, historical disabled Models fallback remains and may be private/loopback.
Optional malformed Gateway settings do not add disabled-mode startup requirements.
`config.inference.*` Models billing and upstream settings remain unchanged.

The enabled Den API and Gateway receive required `secretKeyRef` entries for the
same `DEN_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and database credentials. `config.databaseMode: mysql`
uses `secret.keys.databaseUrl`; `planetscale` uses `databaseHost`,
`databaseUsername`, and `databasePassword`. Key remapping is supported. The
existing Secret must contain nonempty credentials and an encryption key of at
least 32 characters; it is never read by Helm. Chart-created Secrets use
`secret.values` and reject missing/placeholder Gateway credentials early.
Pre-install migration hooks keep their existing inline-secret behavior for
chart-created Secrets; use an existing Secret to avoid inline hook credentials.
Regardless of runtime mode, enabled migration Jobs also require the existing
`secret.keys.databaseUrl` / `secret.values.databaseUrl` TCP configuration described
under [Migration TCP configuration](#migration-tcp-configuration).

Admin and webhook endpoints are independently opt-in for canonical deployments:

```yaml
gateway:
  enabled: true
  admin:
    enabled: true
  webhook:
    enabled: true
secret:
  keys:
    gatewayAdminToken: GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN
    gatewayWebhookSecret: GATEWAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

These optional `secret.keys.gateway*` and `secret.values.gateway*` keys override
their `inference*` aliases by presence. Defaults retain the old Secret keys.
Only enabled features require token references; disabled features explicitly
clear both token env aliases so `envFrom` cannot accidentally turn them on.
Shared deployment flags, origins, database keys, and tokens must not be overridden
through per-app `env` when enabled; Helm rejects conflicting configuration.

Retention is separate from member Automations and remains opt-in after the
accounting migration:

```yaml
gateway:
  retention:
    enabled: true
    adminTokenSecret: gateway-retention
    adminTokenKey: GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN
```

Set service enablement as well (`gateway.enabled` or legacy `inference.enabled`).
Retention's reference is authoritative for **both** `GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN` and
`INFERENCE_ADMIN_TOKEN` on the Gateway and CronJob, even if the shared Secret
contains different tokens. It enables admin access without requiring
`gateway.admin.enabled`. Do not set token env overrides. The retained CronJob
name, schedule and internal Service target do not change automatically.

Render-only verification: `bash packaging/helm/harness-ee/tests/gateway.sh`.
This does not deploy resources, run migrations, or invoke the retention endpoint.
`bash packaging/helm/harness-ee/tests/upgrade-and-migration.sh` additionally
simulates reused computed chart values without the new Gateway defaults and
checks the rendered migration environment against the real bootstrap connection
parser functions in isolation. It never executes the bootstrap entrypoint or
opens a database connection. Run this contract test from a repository checkout
with Node.js and Helm available; it reads the backend parser source, not a deployed
application or a database.

## Install

Published releases are available as an OCI Helm chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install harness-ee oci://ghcr.io/different-ai/charts/harness-ee \
  --version REPLACE_HARNESS_VERSION \
  -f values.prod.yaml
```

`--version` pins the chart and the images: the published chart's `appVersion`
equals its version and `image.tag` defaults to that `appVersion`, so
`--version X` deploys the `X` images. Set `image.tag` only to deviate from the
chart version, for example when you mirror a specific image build. Charts
published before this default (0.18.46 and earlier) ship `image.tag: latest`,
which floats to the newest release on every pull; check with
`helm show values oci://ghcr.io/different-ai/charts/harness-ee --version X | grep -A1 '^image:'`
and, when it prints `tag: latest`, also pass `--set image.tag=X`.

Create a values file for the target environment:

```yaml
config:
  tenancy:
    # Default chart behavior is single-org for private/self-hosted installs.
    # Hosted Harness Cloud should set this to "multi_org" explicitly.
    mode: "single_org"
    singleOrgName: "Harness"
    singleOrgSlug: "default"
    ownerEmails: "admin@example.com"
    allowPublicSignup: "false"
    requireEmailVerification: "false"
  public:
    # Single public Den web origin. The chart renders this as DEN_BASE_URL and
    # den-api derives Better Auth, CORS/trusted origins, web-app hosts, API
    # defaults, and MCP resource defaults from it.
    webOrigin: "https://harness.example.com"
    # Leave these blank unless you intentionally expose a split Den API origin
    # or need migration compatibility with an older topology.
    apiOrigin: ""
    mcpResourceUrl: ""
    mcpClaimNamespace: "https://harness.example.com"
    desktopDenBaseUrl: ""
    corsOrigins: ""
    betterAuthTrustedOrigins: ""
    webAppHosts: ""
    bootstrapAdminEmails: "admin@example.com"
    # Self-hosted default: every organization gets install downloads.
    installLinksGatingEnabled: "false"
    authCallbackUrl: "https://harness.example.com"
  githubConnector:
    appId: ""
    clientId: ""

secret:
  values:
    # Transitional/smoke TLS only: sslaccept=accept encrypts without certificate verification.
    # For production verification, use customCa plus sslmode=verify-full or verify-ca.
    databaseUrl: "mysql://harness:REPLACE_ME@mysql.example.internal:3306/harness_den?sslaccept=accept"
    betterAuthSecret: "REPLACE_WITH_AT_LEAST_32_CHARACTERS"
    denDbEncryptionKey: "REPLACE_WITH_AT_LEAST_32_CHARACTERS"
    emailFrom: "Harness <no-reply@example.com>"
    smtpHost: "smtp.example.com"
    smtpPort: "587"
    smtpUser: "harness@example.com"
    smtpPass: "REPLACE_ME"
    smtpSecure: "false"
    githubConnectorAppClientSecret: ""
    githubConnectorAppPrivateKey: ""
    githubConnectorAppWebhookSecret: ""

ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: nginx
  web:
    host: harness.example.com
  api:
    host: api.harness.example.com
```

### Upgrade note: public URL values

Current chart versions make `config.public.webOrigin` the primary public URL.
It renders as `DEN_BASE_URL`, and Den derives these values from it unless you
set explicit compatibility overrides:

- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
- `CORS_ORIGINS`
- `DEN_BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
- `DEN_WEB_APP_HOSTS`
- `DEN_API_PUBLIC_URL`
- `DEN_MCP_RESOURCE_URL`

When upgrading an existing release, inspect your values file for the older
split-origin keys under `config.public`. If your deployment is single-origin,
remove `apiOrigin`, `mcpResourceUrl`, `desktopDenBaseUrl`, `corsOrigins`,
`betterAuthTrustedOrigins`, and `webAppHosts` or set them to `""` so Den can
derive them from `webOrigin`. Keep `apiOrigin`/`mcpResourceUrl` only when you
intentionally expose a separate API origin for install-link exchange or external
MCP clients.

For private GHCR packages, authenticate before installing:

```bash
helm registry login ghcr.io
kubectl create secret docker-registry ghcr-pull-secret \
  --docker-server=ghcr.io \
  --docker-username=<github-user> \
  --docker-password=<github-token>
```

Then add:

```yaml
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: ghcr-pull-secret
```

For local development from a repository checkout, render or install directly.
The checkout's `Chart.yaml` carries a placeholder `appVersion` (the publish
workflow stamps the real one with `helm package --app-version`), so a checkout
install must set `image.tag` explicitly:

```bash
helm template harness-ee ./packaging/helm/harness-ee -f values.prod.yaml
helm upgrade --install harness-ee ./packaging/helm/harness-ee \
  --set image.tag=REPLACE_HARNESS_VERSION \
  -f values.prod.yaml
```

### Automations rollout

The Helm chart advertises Automations as unavailable by default for self-hosted
and customer-managed deployments. Availability and server shutdown are
separate so a Den upgrade cannot remove routes beneath an older published
Desktop:

| `automationsEnabled` | `automationsRuntimeEnabled` | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"false"` | `"true"` | New Desktops hide Automations; legacy routes and scheduling remain available during the upgrade window. |
| `"false"` | `"false"` | Automations are hard-disabled: routes, MCP resources, and scheduler startup are omitted. |
| `"true"` | `"true"` | Automations are available and execute normally. |
| `"true"` | `"false"` | The runtime shutdown wins and Desktop receives `automationsEnabled: false`. |

Set both values explicitly when the deployment is ready to run Automations:

```yaml
config:
  public:
    automationsEnabled: "true"
    automationsRuntimeEnabled: "true"
```

These render `DEN_AUTOMATIONS_ENABLED=true` and
`DEN_AUTOMATIONS_RUNTIME_ENABLED=true` for Den. An entirely unconfigured Den
keeps availability fail-closed while preserving the legacy runtime. When using
raw environment variables, an explicit `DEN_AUTOMATIONS_ENABLED` value also
becomes the runtime default: `false` is therefore a complete shutdown unless
`DEN_AUTOMATIONS_RUNTIME_ENABLED=true` explicitly selects mixed-version
compatibility. The chart always renders both values to make that choice
unambiguous. Hosted Harness Cloud explicitly enables availability.

Desktop v0.18.35 and newer consume the value from `/v1/me/desktop-config`, hide
the Automation surface, and do not register a runner unless the value is
explicitly true. Older clients predate that contract, so the runtime flag must
remain true while they are in use even when availability is false.

For an existing deployment, stage the upgrade so independently released Den
and Desktop versions never observe an unintended flag state:

1. Keep `config.public.automationsRuntimeEnabled: "true"` while any connected
   Desktop is older than v0.18.35.
2. Upgrade Den. Legacy Desktops retain their existing routes and scheduling;
   compatible Desktops honor `automationsEnabled` from desktop config.
3. Roll out Desktop v0.18.35 or newer to the whole deployment.
4. To keep Automations, set both values to true. To disable them, set both
   values to false only after the Desktop rollout is complete.

New installations with no legacy Desktop clients can hard-disable Automations
immediately by setting both values to false.

### Dashboards rollout

The organization-managed Dashboard is unavailable by default. Enable it for a
self-hosted or customer-managed deployment with:

```yaml
config:
  public:
    dashboardsEnabled: "true"
```

The chart renders this value as `DEN_DASHBOARDS_ENABLED`. Raw environment-based
deployments can set the same variable directly. Hosted environments use that
same flag, so Dashboard availability does not depend on a per-device preference.
Desktop reads `dashboardEnabled` from `/v1/me/desktop-config` and hides both the
sidebar entry and route unless the server explicitly returns `true`.

### Harness Web rollout

Harness Web is unavailable by default for self-hosted and customer-managed
deployments. Harness Cloud enables it in its deployment values with:

```yaml
config:
  public:
    harnessWebEnabled: "true"
```

The chart renders this value as `DEN_HARNESS_WEB_ENABLED`. A raw environment
deployment can set the same variable directly. Missing, blank, false, or an
unrecognized value fails closed: Den omits Web from its advertised
capabilities, the sidebar and Billing offer stay hidden, and Web billing routes
return the deployment-unavailable response. Availability is deployment-wide;
it does not depend on organization mode, Stripe-variable presence, or mutable
organization metadata.

Enabling the flag advertises the hosted product. The deployment must also
configure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_HARNESS_WEB_PRICE_ID` before the
purchase action becomes available. This separate billing-readiness check keeps
a partially configured hosted rollout visible but non-purchasable instead of
mistaking secrets for an availability signal.

Provider-specific starter guides:

- AWS EKS:
  [guide](../../../docs/aws-eks-helm.md),
  [`examples/values.aws-load-balancer.yaml`](examples/values.aws-load-balancer.yaml),
  [`examples/values.aws-load-balancer-http-smoke.yaml`](examples/values.aws-load-balancer-http-smoke.yaml).
  The recommended first AWS path is EKS Auto Mode plus `LoadBalancer` Services,
  which provisions AWS Network Load Balancers without installing an ingress
  controller.
- Azure AKS:
  [guide](../../../docs/azure-aks-helm.md),
  [`examples/values.azure-ingress.yaml`](examples/values.azure-ingress.yaml).
  The recommended first Azure path is VNet-first AKS application routing plus
  Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server private access, with
  `ingress.enabled=true`.
- Google Cloud GKE:
  [guide](../../../docs/gcp-gke-helm.md),
  [`examples/values.gcp-ingress.yaml`](examples/values.gcp-ingress.yaml).
  The recommended first GCP path is GKE Ingress with a reserved global IP,
  Google-managed certificate, and BackendConfig health checks.

`ingress.enabled=true` only emits Kubernetes `Ingress` resources; it does not
install an ingress controller. Use it only when the cluster already has a
compatible provider ingress controller.

## Secrets

The chart can create an Opaque Secret from `secret.values`, or consume an existing Secret:

```yaml
secret:
  create: false
  existingSecret: harness-ee-secrets
```

The existing Secret must contain the keys listed under `secret.keys`, especially:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- `DEN_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

Set optional `DATABASE_REDIS_URL` to enable Den API Redis-backed session and query caching. Set `DAYTONA_API_KEY` when `config.provisioner.mode` is `daytona`. Set `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` when Polar feature gating is enabled. Set `OPENROUTER_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY` when enabling Harness Models management.

Redis cache examples:

```yaml
secret:
  values:
    databaseRedisUrl: "rediss://redis-master.harness.svc.cluster.local:6379"
```

Prefer `rediss://`. For hosting platforms that only provide a private internal
`redis://` URL, such as Render internal Redis, explicitly acknowledge the trust
boundary with `redis.allowInsecureInternal=true`. Use this only when the Redis
endpoint is non-public and reachable only from trusted services in the private
network.

```yaml
redis:
  allowInsecureInternal: true
secret:
  values:
    databaseRedisUrl: "redis://red-...:6379"
```

## Custom CA certificates

For higher-level planning across desktop, sidecar, Den, and MySQL trust
surfaces, see the published
[Certificate trust and proxies](../../../packages/docs/start-here/certificate-trust-and-proxies.mdx)
page. This section remains the authoritative chart values reference.

Use `customCa` when Harness must trust a private certificate authority for
strict TLS verification, such as a MySQL endpoint signed by an internal or cloud
private CA. The chart does not accept PEM material in values and does not create
the CA resource for you; create the Kubernetes Secret or ConfigMap in the
release namespace before running `helm install` or `helm upgrade`.

Secret example:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic harness-custom-ca \
  --namespace harness \
  --from-file=ca.crt=./corp-root-ca.pem
```

```yaml
customCa:
  enabled: true
  existingSecret: harness-custom-ca
  existingConfigMap: ""
  key: ca.crt
```

ConfigMap example:

```bash
kubectl create configmap harness-custom-ca \
  --namespace harness \
  --from-file=ca.crt=./corp-root-ca.pem
```

```yaml
customCa:
  enabled: true
  existingSecret: ""
  existingConfigMap: harness-custom-ca
  key: ca.crt
```

When enabled, set exactly one of `existingSecret` or `existingConfigMap`, and set
`key` to the data key containing the CA bundle. The chart mounts only that key as
`/etc/harness/custom-ca/ca-bundle.pem` and sets `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to that
file for `den-api`, `den-web`, enabled `inference`, and the migration Job. Do
not also set `denApi.env.NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `denWeb.env.NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`,
or `inference.env.NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`; Helm rejects those conflicts while
`customCa.enabled=true`.

For strict MySQL TLS verification, pair the mounted CA with a verifying
`DATABASE_URL`, for example:

```yaml
secret:
  values:
    databaseUrl: "mysql://harness:REPLACE_DB_PASSWORD@mysql.example.internal:3306/harness_den?sslmode=verify-full"
```

`sslmode=require`, `sslmode=verify-ca`, `sslmode=verify-full`, and
`sslaccept=strict` all enable strict certificate verification in Den's MySQL
client: the chain must be trusted and the certificate must carry the database
hostname in its SAN (`verify-ca` behaves like `verify-full`). A private-CA
database therefore needs `customCa` with every one of these modes. Only
`sslaccept=accept` keeps TLS enabled without verifying the certificate chain, so
use it only for smoke tests or while preparing the CA bundle.

The custom CA is release-wide for Node.js processes in this chart. Treat it as a
global trust decision for outbound TLS from those workloads, and include only CA
roots your Harness deployment should trust. On CA rotation, update the existing
Secret or ConfigMap and restart the running workloads so Node reloads the CA
file, for example:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/harness-ee-den-api --namespace harness
kubectl rollout restart deployment/harness-ee-den-web --namespace harness
kubectl rollout restart deployment/harness-ee-inference --namespace harness
```

The next migration hook Job will mount the current CA data; rerun a failed
upgrade after the CA resource is corrected.

## Observability

The chart exposes first-class runtime observability settings for `den-api` and
`den-web` only. `observability.backend` defaults to `none`; set it to `otel` or
`sentry` to enable the matching runtime environment. The chart injects distinct
`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` values directly into each Deployment, so the shared
ConfigMap is not used for service identity or auth-like observability values.

OpenTelemetry uses OTLP over `http/protobuf`, with a shared endpoint and
optional per-signal endpoint overrides. Per-signal exporters default to `otlp`,
and trace sampling defaults to the standard parent-based always-on sampler.

### OpenTelemetry quick start

Before starting, you need:

- An OpenTelemetry Collector or vendor endpoint reachable from the Kubernetes
  cluster over OTLP HTTP. Port `4318` is the usual Collector port.
- The endpoint's authentication token or headers, if it requires
  authentication.
- `kubectl` and Helm configured for the target cluster.

The chart configures telemetry export from Harness; it does not install an
OpenTelemetry Collector. For an in-cluster Collector, use its Kubernetes DNS
name, for example
`http://otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4318`. Do not use
`localhost`, because that would refer to the Harness container itself.

First create the namespace used by this example:

```bash
kubectl create namespace harness
```

If the Collector does not require authentication, skip the Secret and leave
`observability.otel.headers.existingSecret` empty.

If it requires a bearer token, create the header Secret in the **same
namespace as Harness**:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic harness-otel-headers \
  --namespace harness \
  --from-literal=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=Bearer <token>'
```

Replace `<token>` with the real token. Keep the single quotes so your shell
passes the complete header as one value. To update an existing Secret without
deleting it first, use:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic harness-otel-headers \
  --namespace harness \
  --from-literal=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=Bearer <token>' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Multiple OTLP headers use the standard comma-separated `key=value` format:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic harness-otel-headers \
  --namespace harness \
  --from-literal=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=Bearer <token>,x-scope-orgid=<tenant>'
```

Do not put tokens directly in a values file. Kubernetes Secrets are not
encrypted by default unless your cluster enables encryption at rest, so use
your organization's external-secret or secret-management system in production
when available.

Create `values-observability.yaml`:

```yaml
observability:
  backend: otel
  serviceNames:
    denApi: harness-den-api
    denWeb: harness-den-web
  otel:
    endpoint: "http://otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4318"
    tracesEndpoint: ""
    metricsEndpoint: ""
    logsEndpoint: ""
    exporters:
      traces: otlp
      metrics: otlp
      logs: otlp
    tracesSampler: parentbased_always_on
    tracesSamplerArg: ""
    headers:
      existingSecret: harness-otel-headers
      key: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
```

For a Collector without authentication, use:

```yaml
    headers:
      existingSecret: ""
      key: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
```

Install or upgrade Harness with the values file:

```bash
helm upgrade --install harness-ee oci://ghcr.io/different-ai/charts/harness-ee \
  --version REPLACE_HARNESS_VERSION \
  --namespace harness \
  --create-namespace \
  --values values-observability.yaml
```

`observability.otel.headers.existingSecret` must name an existing Kubernetes
Secret. Its key is exposed as `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` only on `den-api` and
`den-web`; it is not added to inference pods or migration Jobs.

### Verify the OpenTelemetry setup

The commands below assume the Helm release is named `harness-ee`. If you use a
different release name, run `kubectl get deployments,services --namespace
harness` to find the generated resource names.

Confirm that the workloads are ready:

```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace harness
kubectl rollout status deployment/harness-ee-den-api --namespace harness
kubectl rollout status deployment/harness-ee-den-web --namespace harness
```

Inspect the rendered environment references without printing the Secret's
value:

```bash
kubectl describe deployment/harness-ee-den-api --namespace harness
kubectl describe deployment/harness-ee-den-web --namespace harness
```

Look for `DEN_OBSERVABILITY_BACKEND=otel`, distinct `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` values,
the OTLP endpoint, and an `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` reference to
`harness-otel-headers`.

Generate a request that crosses both services. Keep this port-forward running:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/harness-ee-den-web 3005:3005 --namespace harness
```

In another terminal:

```bash
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  http://127.0.0.1:3005/api/auth/get-session >/dev/null
```

Den Web proxies `/api/auth/*` server-side to Den API and forwards the active
`traceparent`, so your observability backend should show `harness-den-web` and
`harness-den-api` with one connected trace for the request; an anonymous
session lookup returns `200` with a `null` body. Logs from both services carry
trace and span IDs. Den API also exports Hono request-duration and
active-request metrics.

Do not use `/api/den/...` for this check: Den Web answers those paths with a
`307` redirect to the public API origin instead of proxying them, `curl --fail`
treats the redirect as success, and Den API never receives the request. Health
paths (`/api/health`, `/api/ready`, and Den API `/health` and `/ready`) are
excluded from tracing on purpose.

### Endpoint and troubleshooting notes

- `observability.otel.endpoint` is a base endpoint. Harness appends
  `/v1/traces`, `/v1/metrics`, and `/v1/logs`.
- Signal-specific endpoints are used exactly as written. Include the full
  signal path, such as `https://collector.example.com/v1/traces`.
- Only OTLP HTTP/protobuf is supported. Port `4317` is normally OTLP gRPC and
  will not work; use the HTTP receiver, usually port `4318`.
- The Secret must be in the Harness release namespace, and its key must match
  `observability.otel.headers.key` exactly.
- A `401` or `403` exporter error usually means the token or header syntax is
  wrong. A connection error usually means the endpoint is not reachable from
  the pod or a NetworkPolicy blocks it.
- After changing an externally managed Secret, restart the deployments if your
  secret controller does not trigger a rollout:

  ```bash
  kubectl rollout restart deployment/harness-ee-den-api --namespace harness
  kubectl rollout restart deployment/harness-ee-den-web --namespace harness
  ```
- For lower production trace volume, use
  `tracesSampler: parentbased_traceidratio` with `tracesSamplerArg: "0.1"` to
  sample approximately ten percent of root traces.

For Sentry runtime capture, configure the DSN directly or through an existing
Secret. Helm runtime pods intentionally do not receive `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`,
`SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, or `SENTRY_URL`; those are build-time source-map
upload settings, not runtime settings.

```yaml
observability:
  backend: sentry
  sentry:
    dsnSecret:
      existingSecret: harness-sentry-runtime
      key: SENTRY_DSN
    tracesSampleRate: "0.01"
    environment: production
    release: "2026.07.11"
```

Sentry Logs default to warning-and-error only through `SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=warn`.
Set `SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=info` only during short debugging windows if you need
successful request logs in Sentry; stdout JSON logs remain available either way.

Sentry source-map upload is build-time behavior. Helm configures runtime pods
after images already exist, so it cannot retroactively upload source maps for
Vercel or CI builds. Set `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`,
and `SENTRY_URL` in the build environment that creates the image (for example,
Vercel project build environment variables), not in Helm values or the chart
ConfigMap. The generic published images cannot upload source maps after they
are built; build your own image with CI/BuildKit source-map secrets when you
need uploaded artifacts. `packaging/docker/Dockerfile.den-web` accepts optional
BuildKit secret IDs `sentry_auth_token`, `sentry_org`, `sentry_project`,
`sentry_url`, `sentry_release`, and `sentry_dist`; the EE image publish workflow
wires these IDs from GitHub Secrets when present.

## GitHub Connector

The GitHub repository connector uses a GitHub App. It is separate from GitHub
OAuth social sign-in. Follow the full setup guide in
[`packages/docs/start-here/github-connector-helm.mdx`](../../../packages/docs/start-here/github-connector-helm.mdx).

Use these public URLs when creating the GitHub App:

- Setup URL: `https://harness.example.com/dashboard/integrations/github`
- Webhook URL: `https://api.harness.example.com/v1/webhooks/connectors/github`

Then set the chart values:

```yaml
config:
  githubConnector:
    appId: "123456"
    clientId: "Iv1.example"

secret:
  values:
    githubConnectorAppClientSecret: "github-app-client-secret-if-used"
    githubConnectorAppPrivateKey: |-
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      ...
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    githubConnectorAppWebhookSecret: "replace-with-the-github-webhook-secret"
```

The chart exposes these to Den API as:

- `GITHUB_CONNECTOR_APP_ID`
- `GITHUB_CONNECTOR_APP_CLIENT_ID`
- `GITHUB_CONNECTOR_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GITHUB_CONNECTOR_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `GITHUB_CONNECTOR_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

If `secret.create=false`, add the three secret-backed keys to the existing
Secret referenced by `secret.existingSecret`. The app ID and client ID come from
the chart ConfigMap.

## Transactional Email

Den API can send transactional email through SMTP. Configure the SMTP values in
the chart Secret:

```yaml
secret:
  values:
    emailFrom: "Harness <no-reply@example.com>"
    smtpHost: "smtp.example.com"
    smtpPort: "587"
    smtpUser: "harness@example.com"
    smtpPass: "REPLACE_ME"
    smtpSecure: "false"
```

These values are exposed to Den API as:

- `EMAIL_FROM`
- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_PORT`
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASS`
- `SMTP_SECURE`

If `secret.create=false`, add those keys to the existing Secret referenced by
`secret.existingSecret`. SMTP delivery requires both `EMAIL_FROM` and
`SMTP_HOST`; leave `smtpHost` blank only when SMTP-backed transactional email
should be disabled.

## Tenancy Mode

The chart defaults to a private single-org deployment:

```yaml
config:
  tenancy:
    mode: "single_org"
    singleOrgName: "Harness"
    singleOrgSlug: "default"
    ownerEmails: "admin@example.com"
    allowPublicSignup: "false"
    requireEmailVerification: "false"
```

These values are exposed to both `den-api` and `den-web` as:

- `DEN_ORG_MODE`
- `DEN_SINGLE_ORG_NAME`
- `DEN_SINGLE_ORG_SLUG`
- `DEN_SINGLE_ORG_OWNER_EMAILS`
- `DEN_SINGLE_ORG_ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP`
- `DEN_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`

In the implemented target state, blank or unset `DEN_ORG_MODE` is treated as `single_org`. The Helm chart sets it explicitly to make rendered manifests clear. Hosted or cloud-style multi-organization deployments should set:

```yaml
config:
  tenancy:
    mode: "multi_org"
    requireEmailVerification: "true"
```

`config.tenancy.ownerEmails` controls who can claim ownership of the singleton deployment organization. `config.public.bootstrapAdminEmails` is separate: it seeds platform/admin allowlist access and does not by itself make a user the singleton organization owner.

## Initial Organization Setup

For self-hosted installs, configure the singleton organization before the first
user signs in:

```yaml
config:
  tenancy:
    mode: "single_org"
    singleOrgName: "Acme"
    singleOrgSlug: "acme"
    ownerEmails: "admin@acme.com"
    requireEmailVerification: "false"
  public:
    bootstrapAdminEmails: "admin@acme.com"
```

For releases that include initial-administrator bootstrap, inject the
release-documented one-time setup secret through the chart's Secret integration.
Do not put the setup code in Helm values, a ConfigMap, source control, logs, or a
PR. After the release is installed and the web host is reachable, open `/setup`,
enter an email configured in `config.tenancy.ownerEmails`, and verify it with the
one-time operator code. Den then creates the Better Auth account, creates or
claims the singleton organization identified by `singleOrgName` and
`singleOrgSlug`, grants owner and configured platform-admin access, and consumes
the setup claim. The code cannot be reused and public signup remains disabled.

Configuring `ownerEmails` or `bootstrapAdminEmails` does not create an account or
password. `ownerEmails` controls singleton-organization ownership;
`bootstrapAdminEmails` controls platform-admin allowlist access. Configure the
initial administrator in both lists when that person needs both roles.

Chart versions without the `/setup` route do not support this private bootstrap
flow. Upgrade to a release that includes initial-administrator bootstrap before
attempting first-user setup; entering the configured email on the normal sign-in
page cannot create the account and no default administrator password exists.

Later users are attached to the same singleton organization. They do not see an
organization creation step, and attempts to create another organization return a
single-org-mode error. If no eligible initial-administrator email is configured,
the private setup flow remains unavailable; it never falls back to allowing an
arbitrary first visitor to claim ownership.

For most production installs, use this first owner account as the break-glass
setup path, then configure SAML/OIDC SSO and SCIM from the organization
settings. Keep `bootstrapAdminEmails` aligned only if that same person should
also have platform/admin allowlist access; it is not a replacement for
`ownerEmails`.

After SAML/OIDC SSO is configured on the singleton organization, the auth
experience becomes SSO-only: root sign-in and sign-up show one "Continue with
SSO" action, other sign-in/sign-up entry points redirect there, and raw
email/password sign-in or sign-up requests are rejected by Den API.

## Internal Service URLs

By default, the chart wires internal services through Kubernetes DNS:

- `DEN_API_BASE=http://<release>-harness-ee-den-api:8788`
- `DEN_AUTH_FALLBACK_BASE=http://<release>-harness-ee-den-api:8788`
- `INFERENCE_PROXY_BASE_URL=http://<release>-harness-ee-inference:8791` when `inference.enabled=true`

Override `config.internal.*` only when routing through a mesh, gateway, or external service.

## Den API Node Options

Set `config.denApiNodeOptions` to pass Node.js runtime flags to `den-api` through
`NODE_OPTIONS` when the container starts. The configured value is stored in the
chart ConfigMap as `DEN_API_NODE_OPTIONS` and defaults to an empty string.
Existing values files that set `denApi.env.NODE_OPTIONS` remain supported and
take precedence, so upgrading does not require changing that configuration.

```yaml
config:
  denApiNodeOptions: "--max-old-space-size=4096"
```

`--use-openssl-ca` only changes how Node reads operating-system trust. It does
not create or mount a private CA bundle into the container; use `customCa` for
that.

## Service Exposure

Each service supports Kubernetes Service metadata and load balancer settings:

```yaml
denWeb:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
    port: 443
    loadBalancerClass: eks.amazonaws.com/nlb
    loadBalancerSourceRanges:
      - 203.0.113.0/24
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: ip
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: arn:aws:acm:...
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: "443"
```

The same shape is available under `denApi.service` and `inference.service`.
`ingress.enabled=true` only emits Kubernetes `Ingress` resources; it does not
install an ingress controller.

## Config Rollouts

Den API, Den Web, and Gateway pods include checksums for the chart-managed
ConfigMap and Secret. Helm upgrades that change runtime config or secrets roll
the pods automatically so environment variables such as public origins, CORS
origins, and database URLs are refreshed.

## Isolated Networks

Use the published [Air-gapped deployment](../../../packages/docs/start-here/air-gapped-deployment.mdx)
and [Outbound network access](../../../packages/docs/start-here/outbound-network-access.mdx)
pages for customer-facing isolation and allowlist planning. The values below are
the chart-level controls.

The chart disables external password breach screening by default so isolated self-hosted installs do not depend on the Have I Been Pwned Pwned Passwords range API. If your deployment has approved outbound access and you want password creation and reset to reject known-compromised passwords through that service, enable it:

```yaml
config:
  auth:
    passwordBreachScreeningEnabled: "true"
```

Local sign-in lockout protections stay enabled either way.

Den API also protects External MCP connection URLs with an SSRF guard. On a
hosted multi-tenant deployment, someone who can add an MCP connection could
otherwise make Den fetch localhost, private-network services, or cloud metadata
addresses from Den's network position.

If a legitimate internal MCP server is blocked in an isolated private-network
deployment, the diagnostic code is `MCP_URL_BLOCKED` and the operator-facing
message is: "Use a public HTTPS MCP URL or change the deployment's
private-network policy through security review."

To allow private-address MCP servers for Den API, enable:

```yaml
config:
  public:
    allowPrivateMcpUrls: "1"
```

This disables SSRF protection for external MCP connection URLs. Enable it only
on a deployment where Den's network position and the set of people who can add
MCP connections are both trusted.

## Migrations

### Migration TCP configuration

The bootstrap script requires a TCP MySQL connection even when the application
runtime uses the PlanetScale HTTP driver. The chart always gives the migration
Job `DATABASE_URL` through the existing `secret.keys.databaseUrl` mapping,
independently of `config.databaseMode`. This preserves the legacy URL path and
its TLS options. No new migration values are required.

For chart-created Secrets, set `secret.values.databaseUrl` to an explicit
`mysql://user:password@tcp-host:3306/database?sslmode=verify-full` URL for the
**same database** used by the application. For an existing Secret, put that URL
in its mapped `DATABASE_URL` key. Runtime `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`
and `DATABASE_PASSWORD` alone are not sufficient for bootstrap's TCP phase;
the application database mode must not determine the migration environment.
The chart does not expose bootstrap's alternative `DATABASE_NAME`/`DATABASE_PORT`
configuration: specify the database name and TCP port in the URL instead.

When migrations are enabled, Helm validates the required key mappings and, for
chart-created Secrets, a nonempty MySQL URL with username, host, database and a
valid TCP port. PlanetScale mode also rejects the chart's placeholder URL rather
than silently targeting the default MySQL host. Existing Secret contents cannot
be checked at render time; the required key reference and bootstrap parser enforce
them at startup. TCP connectivity, TLS trust, DDL privileges, and matching the
runtime database remain operator responsibilities. With `migrations.enabled:
false`, no migration TCP configuration is required by this chart validation.

The migration Job runs as a Helm `pre-install,pre-upgrade` hook by default:

```yaml
migrations:
  enabled: true
  hook: true
  hookDeletePolicy: before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded
  backoffLimit: 2
  activeDeadlineSeconds: 1800
  command:
    - node
  args:
    - /app/ee/packages/den-db/dist/scripts/bootstrap.js
```

The default hook executes the precompiled Den DB bootstrap runner already built into the Den API image. On a completely empty database it applies the build-time current-schema SQL snapshot, records the committed migrations as the baseline, then runs pending migrations with Drizzle ORM. On an existing schema without a Drizzle ledger, it records the baseline before migrating.

### First install on a cold cluster

The hook Job runs the Den API image, and `activeDeadlineSeconds` counts from Job
creation, so it includes pulling that image (about 800 MB) onto a node that has
never run Harness. A `DeadlineExceeded` failure on a first install, with
`kubectl describe pod` showing the pod still `Pulling`, means the pull took
longer than the deadline, not that the migration failed. Two timers apply:

- `migrations.activeDeadlineSeconds` (default `1800`): the Job's own limit.
- Helm `--timeout` (default `5m0s`): how long Helm waits for the hook. Pass at
  least `--timeout 30m` on a first install so Helm does not give up before the
  Job does.

To keep a cold install predictable, pre-pull or mirror the images so the hook
starts immediately: mirror `harness-den-api` and `harness-den-web` into a
registry near the cluster and set `denApi.image.repository` and
`denWeb.image.repository` (see
[Air-gapped deployment](../../../packages/docs/start-here/air-gapped-deployment.mdx)),
or pull the tag on each node ahead of time with the node's container runtime
(`crictl pull ghcr.io/vaishnavjai/harness-den-api:<version>`). The default
`image.pullPolicy: IfNotPresent` reuses a pre-pulled image.

To recover from a failed first install, rerun the same `helm upgrade --install`
command: the `before-hook-creation` delete policy replaces the failed Job and
Helm 3.2.1 or newer upgrades over a `failed` first revision. Only if Helm
reports `has no deployed releases`, or `helm list` shows the release as
`pending-install`, run `helm uninstall` and install again.

For retained-log troubleshooting, temporarily disable hook behavior and reduce
retries:

```yaml
migrations:
  enabled: true
  hook: false
  backoffLimit: 0
```

The hook Job currently renders `DATABASE_URL` and `DEN_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` into
the Job environment when `secret.create=true`, because pre-install hooks run
before normal chart resources. Avoid sharing `kubectl describe job` output
without redacting secrets.

## Install links

The migration Job creates the `install_link` and `desktop_connect_grant` tables
automatically when `migrations.enabled=true`. Hosted deployments that enable
install-link gating must opt organizations in through `/admin`; self-hosted
deployments default to enabled. See the
[operator guide](../../../docs/org-install-links.md) and the published
[Installer delivery](../../../packages/docs/start-here/installer-delivery.mdx)
page.

Optional installer artifact values:

```yaml
config:
  public:
    installerReleaseTag: "v0.17.9"
    installerReleaseRepo: "vaishnavjai/harness"

installerArtifacts:
  enabled: true
  existingClaim: harness-desktop-artifacts
  mountPath: /var/lib/harness/installer-artifacts
```

Use either `installerArtifacts.existingClaim` or `installerArtifacts.hostPath`,
not both.

### Guided desktop setup

The organization download page hands the normal Harness app its Den
configuration in an explicit second step. The default is a short-lived,
single-use HTTPS exchange and needs no key configuration:

```yaml
config:
  public:
    connectLinkMode: exchange
```

Den validates the install token and then either:

- streams the standard installer already mounted at
  `installerArtifacts.mountPath`; or
- redirects the browser directly to the exact configured GitHub release asset.

Den does not download, cache, wrap, or ZIP GitHub artifacts. The organization
setup stays in the **Open Harness** deep-link step after installation.

For an optional signed handoff, explicitly select signed mode and configure a
dedicated Ed25519 key whose public key is already trusted by the desktop build:

```yaml
config:
  public:
    connectLinkMode: signed
    connectLinkKeyId: "owc-2026-07"

secret:
  values:
    connectLinkPrivateKey: |-
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      ...
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

For an existing Secret, put the private key under the key named by
`secret.keys.connectLinkPrivateKey` (default `DEN_CONNECT_LINK_PRIVATE_KEY`).
`scripts/generate-connect-link-keypair.mjs` can generate a pair, but a standard
desktop build will reject it until the matching public key ships in that build.

For a semi-air-gapped deployment, mount these normal release filenames (where
`<version>` is `installerReleaseTag` without its leading `v`):

- `harness-mac-arm64-<version>.dmg`
- `harness-mac-x64-<version>.dmg`
- `harness-win-x64-<version>.exe`
- `harness-linux-x86_64-<version>.AppImage`
- `harness-linux-arm64-<version>.AppImage`

Without mounted artifacts, client networks must permit the configured GitHub
release URL and GitHub's redirected release-asset host. With mounted artifacts,
the browser only talks to Den. Use a shared read-only PVC when
`denApi.replicaCount` is greater than one. Connection grants are stored and
consumed in MySQL, so the guided flow is safe when preview and acceptance land
on different API replicas.

## Health Probes

The chart uses the existing service health endpoints:

- `den-api`: `GET /health`
- `den-web`: `GET /api/health`
- `inference`: `GET /health`

Readiness probes use dependency-aware endpoints:

- `den-api`: `GET /ready`
- `den-web`: `GET /api/ready`
- `inference`: `GET /ready`

## Worker Provisioning Recovery

`den-api` periodically reconciles cloud workers that remain in `provisioning` beyond `config.provisioner.reconcileStaleMs`. This lets a replacement pod resume provisioning after a crash. Keep `denApi.replicaCount: 1` unless your worker provider operations are idempotent or you add external leader election.
