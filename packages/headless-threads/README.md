# @harness/headless-threads

Drive a native Harness thread from code, without rendering the app.

A "thread" here is an ordinary Harness session. Same workspace, same managed
OpenCode engine, same session id, same persisted messages, tool activity, and
final state the desktop UI shows. A thread this package creates can be opened
in the app afterwards, because there is no separate headless thread type.

This is a client, not a runtime. It adds no chat engine, no session store, no
model gateway, and no new server route — it is a typed workflow over the
official OpenCode SDK through Harness's workspace-scoped proxy.

## Why

Anything that drives Harness without a UI — a load check, an automation
harness, an agent-quality benchmark — currently re-implements the same
sequence by hand against raw HTTP: create a session, submit `prompt_async`,
poll `/session/status`, poll messages, work out when the turn actually
finished, then dig text back out of message parts.
Legacy harnesses contained one such copy. This package is that sequence, typed
and tested once.

Note what the hand-rolled version has to get right, and what this package now
owns: a thread is still `idle` in the gap between accepting a prompt and
starting work, so waiting for "not busy" alone reports a turn finished before
it began. Settling requires a non-running status **and** an assistant message
that was not there when the turn was submitted.

## Use

```ts
import { createHeadlessThreadClient } from "@harness/headless-threads";

const threads = createHeadlessThreadClient({
  baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8787",
  workspaceId: "ws_1",
  token: process.env.HARNESS_TOKEN,
  defaultModel: { providerId: "anthropic", modelId: "claude-sonnet-5" },
});

const thread = await threads.createThread({
  title: "Refund policy",
  prompt: "A customer wants a refund after 40 days. What are their options?",
});

await threads.waitForThread(thread.id, { timeoutMs: 120_000 });

const followUp = await threads.sendTurn(thread.id, {
  prompt: "They also lost the receipt.",
});
const waited = await threads.waitForThread(thread.id, {
  timeoutMs: 120_000,
  since: followUp,
});

if (waited.outcome === "settled") {
  const transcript = await threads.exportTranscript(thread.id);
  console.log(transcript.finalAssistantText);
}
```

`thread.id` is the native session id. Opening Harness on the same workspace
shows this conversation in the sidebar.

## Contract

`AgentSessionClient` is the intentionally small replaceable runtime port:
create a thread, send a turn, read a snapshot, and abort. `HeadlessThreadClient`
extends it with polling and transcript helpers. OpenCode is currently the only
implementation; UI inventory and cross-workspace plugin routing stay on the
native protocol instead of expanding this port speculatively.

| Function | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `createThread` | Creates a thread, optionally with its first turn and a model. |
| `sendTurn` | Submits a turn and returns an acceptance that records the pre-turn message count. |
| `waitForThread` | Polls to a bounded deadline. Returns `settled`, `timeout`, or `aborted` — never throws on a slow thread. |
| `getThreadSnapshot` | Status, messages, and todos as Harness stores them. |
| `abortThread` | Requests a stop. Acceptance is not proof the run ended; wait afterwards to observe idle. |
| `exportTranscript` | Flattens a snapshot into per-message text, reasoning, and tool calls. |

`waitForThread` reports an outcome rather than throwing, so a caller running
many threads can record a timeout as a result instead of losing the run.
Transport and payload failures throw `HeadlessThreadError`, which carries
`code`, `status`, `method`, `path`, and the server's body.

Deterministic by construction: inject `fetch`, `now`, and `sleep` to run the
whole contract against fixtures with no wall-clock dependency.

## Test

```bash
pnpm --filter @harness/headless-threads test
```

The end-to-end proof lives with the server it drives, in
`apps/server/src/headless-threads.e2e.test.ts`, and runs against a real
Harness server:

```bash
pnpm --filter @harness/server test src/headless-threads.e2e.test.ts
```
