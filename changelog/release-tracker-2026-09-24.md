- The composer's paperclip and tools buttons are replaced by one **+** menu; attach files from its first row or with ⌘U / Ctrl+U.
- The built-in browser toolbar no longer has a **Suspend** button.
- Link menus no longer list individual installed browsers; the choices are Harness or your default browser.
- The Library says **Remove** instead of **Uninstall** (connections still say **Disconnect**).
- Den's **My Model Connections** page now opens the Models section of My Library.
- AI Gateway's old Gateway pages are gone; old list, new, detail and edit links return 404, and `/dashboard/inference` links forward to the Models tab.
- Users & Teams in AI Gateway is read-only; access is changed in AI Providers and limits in Limits.
- Manage › Plugins no longer shows GitHub sources and marketplaces; they remain reachable at their old links.
- Removing a connector or plugin in Harness Cloud now asks for confirmation.
