/**
 * A packaged enterprise desktop on a machine that has never run Harness,
 * booted behind a logging forward proxy that refuses everything. Before the
 * person enters their workspace address the install knows no organization
 * server, so any request that leaves loopback goes to a host nobody chose:
 * the hosted runtime-config probe, PostHog analytics, Cloud inventory.
 *
 * The witness is Chromium's `--proxy-server` switch, which the desktop accepts
 * through ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS. Every renderer `fetch`, every
 * main-process `net.fetch` (the `__fetch` bridge Den calls use) and
 * electron-updater all go through Chromium's network stack, so each request
 * for a non-loopback host arrives here as either a plain request with an
 * absolute URL or a `CONNECT host:443` tunnel for HTTPS. Loopback is bypassed
 * by Chromium's implicit proxy rules and never shows up. The proxy answers
 * 403 and closes, so nothing actually leaves the machine during the run.
 * Chromium's own background traffic is caught too: on Linux the unfixed build
 * also surfaced the spellchecker's Hunspell dictionary download
 * (redirector.gvt1.com), which macOS never makes because it uses the native
 * spellchecker.
 *
 * Not covered: Node's own `fetch` in the main process ignores Chromium proxy
 * switches. The desktop only uses it for its loopback local server.
