# Blank-slate test profiles

Every desktop build (public, cloud, enterprise) accepts a `--blank-slate` CLI
flag that launches the app as if on a brand-new machine, without touching the
installed profile.

## Usage

Packaged app (macOS):

```bash
open -a "Harness Enterprise" --args --blank-slate
# or any flavor:
open -a "Harness" --args --blank-slate
```

Direct binary (useful for CDP-driven testing):

```bash
HARNESS_ELECTRON_REMOTE_DEBUG_PORT=9898 \
  "dist-electron/mac-arm64/Harness Enterprise.app/Contents/MacOS/Harness Enterprise" --blank-slate
```

Dev mode:

```bash
pnpm dev:electron -- --blank-slate
```

## What it does

Each launch creates one unique temporary root (`$TMPDIR/harness-test-profile-*`)
and redirects every persisted path into it before any other module loads:

- Electron `userData` and `home`
- `HOME`/`USERPROFILE`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`DATA`/`CACHE`/`STATE`,
  `APPDATA`/`LOCALAPPDATA`
- desktop bootstrap (`HARNESS_DESKTOP_BOOTSTRAP_PATH`) — an enterprise build
  therefore starts at the activation gate, not an inherited control plane
- Harness server config, env store, token store, runtime DB, data dir
- OpenCode config dir and database

It also:

- enables Chromium's mock keychain so the real login keychain is never touched
- skips `harness://` protocol registration, Windows shortcut writes, brand
  icon/name persistence, and Linux desktop integration
- suffixes the window title with `Test profile`
- spawns a detached cleanup worker on quit that removes the whole temporary
  root after the app exits

A normal launch (no flag) is byte-for-byte unchanged. Packaged builds keep
their immutable flavor; the flag never alters sign-in or activation policy.
