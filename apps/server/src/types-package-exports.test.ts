/**
 * The packaged builds bundle this app's OpenCode plugins with `--target node`,
 * so every workspace import resolves through the exporting package's own
 * conditions. A subpath that points at `dist/` only resolves after that package
 * has been built, which the Docker and alpha pipelines do not guarantee — and
 * neither typechecks nor bun tests take that route, so nothing catches it
 * before merge. Keep every subpath resolvable from source.
