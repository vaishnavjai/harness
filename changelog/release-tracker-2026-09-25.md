## v0.18.54

Covers everything since `v0.18.52`. The `v0.18.53` release was never published (its Windows builds failed and it stayed a draft), so nobody received it and its changes had no notes. They are documented here instead.

Enterprise sign-in and version pinning are back, plus Amazon Bedrock and model shortcuts

#### Behavior changes and removals
- Harness Enterprise and Harness Cloud desktops hold people at sign-in until they sign in to their organization again. Releases v0.18.49 through v0.18.52 let them work without signing in.
- Allowed desktop versions set in organization settings apply to desktop updates again: a version removed from the list is not installed. Other desktop policies remain unenforced on the desktop while they are redesigned.
- Editing a message while a reply is running replaces the running message instead of queueing the edit.
- Settings › Updates no longer shows inline release notes.
- Model shortcuts no longer open a notice above the composer; Fast shows as a label next to the model name.
