#### Title
Split-view workflows and live sessions get more dependable

#### One-line summary
Adds cross-workspace split view and interrupted-run recovery while keeping live sessions and long-running streams responsive.

#### Main changes
- Added cross-workspace split view and transcript actions for resuming interrupted runs.
- Live session status now survives navigation, workspace switches, and reattachment while long-running streams remain responsive.
- Refined tool-call activity, thought grouping, artifact controls, and Library choices so active work is easier to follow and manage.
- Cloud extension status now reflects real connectivity, remote-session capabilities reach cloud targets, and worker recovery avoids competing owners.
- Added a pull-only Docker evaluation stack and strengthened enterprise licensing documentation and stewardship metadata.

## v0.18.39

#### Commit
`63625a4b`

#### Released at
`2026-08-27T23:29:36Z`

#### Title
Richer session artifacts and more resilient agent runs

#### One-line summary
Moves session files into the artifact rail, adds richer Markdown controls, and strengthens run recovery across desktop, web, and cloud.

#### Main changes
- Session files now live in the artifact rail instead of interrupting the chat transcript, with safer badge layout and responsive behavior on narrow screens.
- Markdown can render Mermaid diagrams safely, and code blocks offer a word-wrap control for long lines.
- Agent runs recover more reliably from idle admissions, queued follow-ups, event-stream restarts, Settings visits, and large workspace session histories.
- Harness Cloud adds per-member managed-model credentials, paid browser access, desktop delivery for remote-session commands, and more reliable worker recovery.
- Electron file transfers now work correctly across the remote bridge, and LiteLLM examples include synchronized model metadata.
