#### Title
Hosted MCP Apps and cloud sign-in become more reliable

#### One-line summary
Routes hosted MCP Apps through the credential-bound Den gateway and hardens cloud sign-in, live sessions, updates, and MCP recovery.

#### Main changes
- Hosted MCP Apps now render through the credential-bound Den gateway, and Connect refreshes its MCP App catalog when cached inventory is incomplete.
- Fixed Den callback routing, API-origin derivation, and cookie forwarding so hosted sign-in remains on the correct domain.
- Workspace switches preserve live agent runs under load, while stale tool activity and scrolling no longer disrupt the active transcript.
- Desktop update channel selection stays stable, Automation control-plane traffic is bounded, and standalone MCP requests stop retrying indefinitely.
- Clarified the difference between local setup, managed Harness Cloud, OpenCode models, and Harness-managed models.
