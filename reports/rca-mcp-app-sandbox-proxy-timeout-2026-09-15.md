# MCP App sandbox proxy timeout — 2026-09-15

## Verdict and scope

**Scoped fix and two-provider hosted matrix: Passed. Installed-Electron verification: Incomplete.**

Audit scope: **root cause reproduced via injected CSS/JS delay; production trigger (slow asset fetch under concurrent tile boots) inferred, not captured**. Calendar is **excluded: requires member OAuth**; its HTTP 401 is by design, not a product defect or a request for an unauthenticated mode.

A controlled browser experiment reproduces the exact reported timeout when either external proxy bootstrap dependency takes longer than the 10-second deadline. The stylesheet blocks the following classic script even when JavaScript has already downloaded. Inlining these small, trusted host constants removes those two requests. A delayed HTML document still times out with diagnostics and now has a working, tile-local Retry.

This is a demonstrated failure mechanism, **not proof that the installed app's incident had the same network delay**. No installed-app network trace was supplied or captured. All browser tests used newly launched, isolated local headless Chrome; no running user app, private profile, production account, or engine database was accessed. No server authentication was changed.

| Matrix | Before | After / qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No faults, ten single + ten six-tile loads | 70/70 delivered, 0 proxy errors | 70/70 delivered, 0 proxy errors |
| 1-second CSS/script delay, six tiles each | 12/12 delivered | Bootstrap no longer requests these assets |
| 11-second CSS/script delay, one + six tiles each | 14/14 exact proxy timeouts, no ready/accept/init | Six tiles each with CSS, JS, or both delayed: 18/18 delivered, zero asset requests |
| Only first HTML document delayed 11 seconds | Deadline behavior remains intentional | One and six-tile cases: one diagnostic each; Retry restores only failed tile; exact input/result once; siblings unchanged |
| Revert inline bootstrap only | Regression spec fails: 0/6 delivered, 6 proxy errors (~30.25 seconds) | Restored fix passes the full deterministic spec |
| Two shared-mode hosted providers: twelve single + twelve six-tile boots (three tiles per provider) | Baseline renderer/proxy from `c67ba51ed`: 84/84 initialized and exact input/result receipts, zero proxy errors | Fixed renderer/proxy: 84/84 initialized and exact input/result receipts, zero proxy errors |
| Calendar | HTTP 401 is intentional | **excluded: requires member OAuth**; no auth changes or further calls |
| Real saved/local-cache and organization dashboards | Code traced | Full dashboard composition, cache/live swaps and Electron partitions **not live-tested** |

## Mechanism and handshake

References are relative to this worktree. Investigation baseline is `c67ba51ed`; `v0.18.47` has identical sandbox renderer/proxy source to that baseline. The reported `0.18.47-alpha` label was not independently mapped to an installed binary SHA.

1. **One existing Harness HTTP server, not one listener per tile.** `apps/server/src/server.ts:1071–1097` awaits `serve` and records its bound port. Static unauthenticated routes `/mcp-apps/sandbox.html`, `.js`, `.css` are registered at `server.ts:3535–3549`, with `Cache-Control: no-store`. MCP discovery or provider tool execution is not in these route handlers. `mcp-app-host.ts` resolves provider resources/launch leases; it does not allocate the outer proxy port per tile.
2. `apps/app/src/app/lib/harness-server.ts:2033–2046` derives the proxy URL and expected origin from the selected server endpoint plus CSP/host-origin query parameters. The provider's `ui://` URI is not a browser navigation URL. Tiles using one endpoint share its origin/HTTP connection resources, not an app-specific server.
3. `apps/app/src/components/chat/mcp-app-frame.tsx:336–380` begins its effect only with resolved resource bytes. `:636–653` installs both parent message listeners **before** the startup queue assigns `iframe.src`. The shared queue at `:36–70` already admits two startups. The 10-second timer begins at navigation, not during queue wait or provider discovery.
4. **Pre-fix bottleneck: `apps/server/src/mcp-app-sandbox.ts:223` at the baseline** emits an external stylesheet followed by an external classic script. A pending stylesheet prevents that script from executing. Ready is a one-shot `postMessage` at script line 219, after validation of the host origin and registration of the proxy relay. An 11-second delay on CSS alone therefore gives `sandbox-navigation-started` with no `sandbox-proxy-ready`, even with downloaded JS.
5. The parent's ready handler (`mcp-app-frame.tsx:548–608`) accepts only that iframe's `contentWindow`, expected origin and ready method. It then connects AppBridge and sends secured HTML. No base64 decoding, provider HTML parsing, `srcdoc` assignment or provider initialization is required for **outer proxy ready**.
6. The outer proxy's sandbox remains `allow-scripts allow-same-origin`; its inner provider frame remains `allow-scripts` (`mcp-app-sandbox.ts:129–139`). Resource bytes are assigned to the opaque inner `srcdoc` only after ready (`:174–190`). The accept and initialized messages have their own existing deadlines. No origin, CSP, device permission, or action authorization was relaxed.

### Why intermittent / why siblings disagree

Each tile navigates independently. One bootstrap request can complete while another is stalled; a shared endpoint does not make those response timelines identical. The faulted six-tile experiment produces three queue-controlled pairs at approximately 10/20/30 seconds. This demonstrates a load-sensitive failure shape matching sibling disagreement, without establishing why a particular installed HTTP request was slow. HTTP connection saturation, renderer scheduling, CSS/script errors, and endpoint-specific faults remain possible triggers, not measured production causes.

The queue and listener-before-navigation fix already landed in #4996. Adding another queue or a blanket/adaptive longer deadline would not remove the demonstrated unnecessary request dependency. The earlier reported five-second chat trace predates the `v0.18.47` release commit timestamp; its exact binary version was not verified. Current chat and dashboard share the same ten-second constant.

### Hypotheses disposition

| Hypothesis | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| Per-tile port exhaustion / listener not listening | No per-tile listener allocation found. Server binding is awaited. Fixture also awaits its listener. Production startup availability was not measured. |
| Timer includes resource bytes/CSP/blob decoding | Provider resource is already resolved. The demonstrated wait is outer proxy CSS/script; provider HTML is delivered later. |
| Ready posted before parent subscribes | Ordinary initial race contradicted by current ordering and 70 immediate successful boots. No production listener buffer is warranted from this evidence. Navigation-generation/refresh races are not ruled out. |
| Saved locally vs organization auto-run | Both converge on `McpAppSandboxView`; cached resources can mount before live refresh completes. Distinct upstream resolution paths do not bypass the proxy. |
| Shared proxy server/lock | Shared server endpoint; global startup queue = 2. Browser request contention possible; no server-wide proxy mutex found. |
| Electron partition/webPreferences under load | Not measured. Test uses isolated headless Chromium, not installed Electron. |

## Surface paths and recovery

- Saved snapshots: `react-app/domains/dashboard/dashboard-apps.tsx:91–116` -> `react-app/domains/apps/generated-app-preview.tsx:16–34` -> shared renderer, read-only.
- Saved live apps: `react-app/domains/apps/live-generated-app.tsx:15–20` -> `McpAppTile`.
- Granted/organization apps: `react-app/domains/dashboard/dashboard-page.tsx:138–159` -> `McpAppTile` -> renderer (`mcp-app-tile.tsx:527–539`).
- Cached "Saved locally / refreshing" mounts and fresh result replacement are at `mcp-app-tile.tsx:158–168,352–367`. This is an additional source of navigation churn, not experimentally attributed here. Overlapping PR #5038 addresses continuity; this branch does not duplicate that work.
- Fix at `mcp-app-sandbox.ts:223–227`: inline only trusted host CSS/JS in the proxy response; preserve external routes for compatibility.
- Fix at `mcp-app-frame.tsx:325,660–666`: Retry clears the diagnostic and creates a fresh effect/iframe using the same resolved input and result. It does not call the launch tool again. Existing diagnostics, origin checks, queue limit and deadlines remain intact.

## Negative-space / why prior tests missed it

| Missing case | Old coverage | New evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N tiles at once, real browser resource pipeline | Scheduling unit tests used synthetic ready events, `about:blank`, fake timers and a mocked bridge | Ten six-tile navigations; actual renderer, AppBridge, client URL builder, proxy HTML/script and opaque inner frame |
| Ready before listener | Current code already subscribes before navigation; synthetic unit signals cannot validate browser order | Real immediate-ready/control runs; no claim that an impossible initial browser ordering was reproduced |
| CSS downloaded late, JS already downloaded | Server VM tests execute script directly; route test inspected headers/body | HTTP finish/abort traces show downloaded JS but absent ready under delayed preceding CSS |
| Timeout followed by usable Retry | Shared error notice had no Retry callback | Real mouse click; exact input/result receipts once; unchanged sibling event sequences; late/aborted HTML response cannot duplicate initialization |
| Live provider + actual dashboard composition | Tile tests mock shared renderer | Two authorized shared-mode providers now pass before/after; calendar excluded by audit; full dashboard/installed Electron still missing |

## Reproduction and evidence

Run from the worktree root, with the requested mise binaries on PATH:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/mise/installs/pnpm/11.4.0:$HOME/.local/share/mise/installs/bun/1.4.0/bin:$HOME/.local/share/mise/installs/node/24.20.0/bin:$PATH"
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir evals install --frozen-lockfile
HARNESS_EVAL_HOST=local pnpm --dir evals run test:e2e specs/mcp-app-sandbox-startup.e2e.test.ts
pnpm --filter @harness/server test src/mcp-app-sandbox.test.ts
pnpm --filter @harness/app exec bun test --isolate tests/mcp-app-frame.test.ts
pnpm --dir evals typecheck
```

Deterministic browser verdict: 3 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. Supplementary server suite: 19 passed / 159 expectations; renderer suite: 60 passed / 1,073 expectations. The browser tests are component integration, not a signed-in dashboard E2E. Unrelated chat card imports are isolated from the fixture; the sandbox/bridge/client/proxy modules are real. The loopback fixture uses the production proxy exports and CSP with an HTTP delay injector; it does not exercise the full Bun server dispatch stack (covered separately by the server suite).

Opt-in fourth test: supply `HARNESS_SANDBOX_DEMO_ENDPOINTS` as a JSON array of the **two** explicitly authorized shared-mode static demo MCP endpoints, then run the same command. URLs and credentials are deliberately not committed. Read-only synthetic demo/input-only schema gates prevent live/private action calls. The original three-provider attempt failed with `provider-3: tools/call failed (HTTP_401)`; audit confirmed member OAuth is required and excluded calendar. No further calendar calls or authentication changes were made.

Before/after procedure: temporarily restore only `apps/app/src/components/chat/mcp-app-frame.tsx` and `apps/server/src/mcp-app-sandbox.ts` from `c67ba51ed`, run the corrected hosted spec with `-t 'opt-in hosted'`, then restore both files to fixed HEAD and run the complete spec. Before: exit 0, 1 passed / 3 filtered-skipped, 12 rotating single and 12 six-tile loads, 84/84 receipts. After: exit 0, **4 passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped**, including the same 84 hosted receipts. No naturally occurring timeout was observed in either hosted run; this does not establish the production trigger. Corrected before receipt: `evals/results/test-runs/2026-09-15T22-30-27-614Z-sandbox-component-integration-opt-in-hosted-demo-matrix-with-anonymous-readiness/test-run.json`. This historical receipt records the fixed branch SHA plus a deliberate baseline product-file override; it is not final-head proof. Final-head after receipts are published separately.

Observer qualification: root-page init scripts do not automatically instrument opaque out-of-process iframes. The first hosted attempt therefore saw initialization but missed inbound receipts; it was a witness failure, not a proxy timeout. The corrected observer attaches to this fixture-owned browser's iframe sessions and installs a capture-phase listener immediately, without modifying provider HTML. Assertions require one observer-ready, one initialize and exact inbound input/result payloads per tile; public traces contain only anonymous counters. Installation is **not guaranteed before provider scripts** (frames reported complete at install); CDP attachment can affect timing. A subsequent baseline attempt caught a teardown race in an unnecessary resume command after successful installation; the observer now resumes only paused targets and waits for setup to settle before navigation. The baseline was rerun with the identical corrected observer used for the after run. Evals typecheck covers 456 files; browser callback check covers 960 callbacks.

Revert-fails control: restore only the baseline external `<link>`/`<script src>` HTML constant, keep the regression tests and Retry, then run:

```sh
HARNESS_EVAL_HOST=local pnpm --dir evals run test:e2e specs/mcp-app-sandbox-startup.e2e.test.ts -t 'inline proxy ignores'
```

Observed exit 1, 1 failed, 2 filtered/skipped, expected 6 deliveries but received 0. Trace `evals/results/mcp-app-sandbox-startup/1789509253288-45838/inline-css-6.json`; failure receipt starts `2026-09-15T21-54-13-267Z`. Restore the fixed constant before the full passing run. Filtered tests are not passed claims.

Private/local investigation traces are under `evals/results/mcp-app-sandbox-startup/`: baseline `1789507807905-50122`, under-deadline control `1789507812991-50122`, delayed baseline `1789507820180-50122`. Each load includes navigation, message, HTTP request/finish/abort timestamps. Ambient assertion receipts live in `evals/results/test-runs/`; final-head receipts are published on the PR. Browser profiles, raw providers, tokens, and private diagnostic bundles are not published. Earlier global lint/ratchet failures outside these new files were not clean-control-classified and are not called pre-existing; scoped checks and typechecking passed.

## Release / demo guidance

Per the audit decision, the green two-shared-provider before/after matrix is sufficient to mark PR #5047 **ready for review**, not to merge or claim installed-release readiness. **Installed-Electron verification remains Incomplete**; real saved/organization dashboard composition is still not exercised. Do not present a synthetic delay reproduction as definitive production attribution.

If the fix cannot ship: pre-open and verify each tile; avoid whole-board refresh immediately before presenting. If a tile fails on the installed build, use its existing tile refresh/reopen control where available, or reopen the conversation/view; avoid repeatedly refreshing healthy siblings. Single-tile control was reliable in the no-fault experiment but is not guaranteed under a genuine network stall. Prepare the already verified static captures as a clearly labeled non-interactive fallback. Validate the exact release/profile before the demo, including the calendar provider's authentication requirement.
