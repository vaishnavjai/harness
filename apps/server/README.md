# Harness Server

Filesystem-backed API for Harness remote clients. This package provides the Harness server layer described in `apps/app/pr/harness-server.md` and is intentionally independent from the desktop app.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaishnavjai/harness.git && cd harness
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter @harness/server prepare:npm
npm install -g ./apps/server/dist/npm
```

Then:

```bash
harness-server --workspace /path/to/workspace --approval auto
```

Harness is not published to npm: the `harness-server` name and the `@harness`
scope on the public registry belong to other projects. Always install from a
checkout of this repository.

The staged package runs on Node.js 22.13 or newer on macOS, Linux, and Windows (arm64 or x64); Bun is not required at runtime.

### Self-hosted web UI

```bash
cd /path/to/workspace
harness-server web --open
```

`harness-server web` serves the Harness web UI and API from one origin and
runs a server-managed OpenCode engine. The npm package bundles the UI and the
OpenCode plugins; on first run it downloads the exact OpenCode version this
release was tested with into `~/.harness/harness-server/engines/` and reuses
it afterwards. To update, pull the checkout and repeat the install steps above.

Defaults in `web` mode: bind `127.0.0.1`, approval `auto`, workspace = current
directory, and the browser is signed in automatically via a bootstrap token
(pass `--no-bootstrap-token` to require pasting the client token). Tokens are
persisted in `~/.harness/harness-server/web-tokens.json` so they survive
restarts; `--token`/`--host-token` or `HARNESS_TOKEN`/`HARNESS_HOST_TOKEN`
override them.

To reach it from other machines, keep the server on `127.0.0.1` and put a TLS
proxy in front (e.g. `tailscale serve --bg --https=8787 http://127.0.0.1:8787`).
Browsers require a secure context for the UI on any non-localhost origin.
Set `HARNESS_OPENCODE_BIN` to use your own OpenCode install instead of the
managed download; `/health` reports both the pinned `opencodeVersion` and the
`opencodeInstalledVersion` actually running.

Or from source:

```bash
pnpm --filter @harness/server dev -- \
  --workspace /path/to/workspace \
  --approval auto
```

The server logs the client token and host token on boot when they are auto-generated.

Add `--verbose` to print resolved config details on startup. Use `--version` to print the server version and exit.

## Desktop task recovery

The desktop enables `resumeInterruptedTasks` when embedding a server that owns
its local engines. Standalone servers, attached engines, remote workspaces, and
read-only servers do not opt in. Recovery works with both OpenCode v1 and v2 and
does not depend on an open conversation tab.

The `desktop_task_recovery` table in the existing runtime SQLite database stores
up to 1,000 task identities, their workspace path, original engine, last observed
user turn, and recovery phase. It stores no prompts, transcripts, or credentials.
Only tasks admitted after this feature is enabled are tracked; old unfinished
conversations are not swept or resumed retroactively.

On quit or update, a final checkpoint runs before engine teardown with two task
snapshots in flight and a 10-second budget. On restart, the coordinator checks two task
snapshots every two seconds and admits at most one continuation every two seconds,
with at most two recovered tasks active. Already-active native runs are observed,
not re-prompted, and native active work also limits new recovery admissions.

Completed, archived, manually stopped, approval/question-blocked, and active
delegated work are excluded. New manual work invalidates the old recovery intent.
Missing workspaces, changed directories, unavailable policy, and unverified
snapshots never authorize a send. V1 requires the original user turn and model
in its recent 100-message snapshot; v2 keeps the session's native model. A
continuation asks to inspect completed effects first, not rerun the original prompt.

A send is claimed durably before admission. Lost acknowledgements are never
blindly retried, even after another restart. Crash recovery requires an observed
running task and a still-unfinished matching turn; unexplained aborts stay stopped.
Tasks whose admission or shutdown checkpoint cannot be confirmed remain manual.
This prevents duplicate recovery admissions, not exactly-once execution of external
tools; uncertain earlier effects must be inspected or clarified before continuing.

Desktop Automation and remote-command requests opt out with
`x-harness-task-recovery: off`; their existing execution ownership is unchanged.
Runtime journey verification for actual Electron restarts on both engines remains
separate from the focused coordinator and mocked-proxy tests.

## MCP App launch ownership

An interactive host sends `context: { sessionId, readOnly, engine? }` with
`POST /workspace/:id/mcp-apps/resolve`. `sessionId` is the originating conversation
or `null` for a dashboard; `engine` is `v1` (default) or `v2`, never a provider URL.
An actionable response includes an opaque `app.launchId`. The host keeps the
server endpoint and workspace that resolved it, rather than the currently
selected workspace. No credential, configuration, or fingerprint is returned.

`POST /workspace/:id/mcp-apps/call` requires that `launchId`, the same `sessionId`
and `engine`, and the existing `serverName`, `resourceUri`, `name`, `arguments`,
and optional `approved` fields. The server binds the lease to its own instance,
workspace path, conversation, original native launch tool, resource URI, and
private configuration fingerprint. It rechecks the original tool's App visibility,
resource binding and availability, original and requested tool policy, current
session ownership/archive state, and configuration before dispatch. Existing
helper audience and approval rules are unchanged.

Leases are process-local, expire after 30 minutes, and are capped at 256 per
server (oldest first eviction). `POST /workspace/:id/mcp-apps/release` with
`{ launchId }` closes one workspace-owned lease. Closing/replacing a conversation
view releases it; the renderer also invalidates its bridge synchronously and
checks liveness before and after approval. A release failure is bounded by lease
expiry. Already-dispatched provider operations cannot be recalled.

The private fingerprint includes effective configuration (including headers),
workspace/global runtime generations of the relevant MCP entry, private Connect authorization
generation, and local managed gateway connection/credential/registration
revisions. Named-entry generations are process-local, like the leases, and track
host runtime writes including removal/restoration. Unrelated provider, plugin,
and other MCP edits do not invalidate a lease. Private Connect hosts track the
`harness-cloud` runtime entry as well as their private authorization generation.
File-backed configuration is compared by its
observed values; edits restored between observations are not observable history.
Provider-side account changes that leave all host-visible credentials and
configuration unchanged are not detectable by this contract.

Compatibility is intentionally fail-closed: older clients may still resolve HTML,
but calls without a lease return `missing_launch_context`; stale leases return
`stale_launch_context` with reopening guidance. New clients on old servers do not
dispatch unbound calls. Generated read-only previews and archived result views
still render and support local interactions without acquiring a lease. Dashboard
HTML/result caches never persist a launch ID and remain read-only until refreshed.

The renderer contract is `McpAppOrigin` and `createMcpAppActions` in
`apps/app/src/components/chat/mcp-app-origin.ts`; `MessageListProvider` receives
it from the owning `SessionSurface`. `McpAppLaunchContext`, resolution, validation,
and release are owned by `src/mcp-app-host.ts`, with HTTP/session checks in
`src/server.ts`.
Internal callers of `callMcpAppTool` must supply `assertSessionActive` for a
conversation lease; omitting the guard fails closed.

Desktop and web renderers poll the same server they are connected to. The first
polling window claims each request; commands are never broadcast to every tab.
Requests expire after five seconds, and a server with no recent renderer poll
returns an explicit no-window result. The external desktop UI MCP bridge remains
available; in-app tools no longer discover or fall back to that bridge.

OpenCode proxy:

- `GET|POST|... /opencode/*`
- `GET|POST|... /w/:id/opencode/*`

## Approvals

All writes are gated by host approval.

Host APIs accept either:

- `X-Harness-Host-Token: <token>` (legacy host token), or
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` where the token scope is `owner`.

Approvals endpoints:

- `GET /approvals`
- `POST /approvals/:id` with `{ "reply": "allow" | "deny" }`

Set `HARNESS_APPROVAL_MODE=auto` to auto-approve during local development.

## Automatic title recovery

The managed v1 engine ships a title-only compatibility plugin. If a provider
returns HTTP 400 with `unsupported_value` or `unsupported_parameter` for
`reasoning.effort`, `reasoning_effort`, `temperature`, or `top_p`, it makes at
most one corrected request. It uses a reported supported effort or omits the
rejected optional parameter so the same model can use its default. Provider,
model, credentials, conversation content, and normal chat options stay intact.
Access, quota, transport, and unrelated request errors do not trigger an added
recovery request. The engine's own transport retry policy still applies.

Engine log records with service `harness.title` / message `Automatic title
generation` contain only session/provider/model IDs, outcome, recovery attempt,
HTTP status, and the rejected parameter name. `accepted_after_recovery` means
the provider accepted the retry; `title_available` separately confirms a real
title was observed in a session update. An accepted request with no title update
within 60 seconds is `title_unconfirmed`, which can mean empty output, a stream
failure, or missing persistence; it is not reported as success. The app's
existing bounded placeholder probes and warning remain the user-facing safety
net. Existing untitled conversations are not bulk-regenerated.
