## v0.18.41

#### Title
Session status gets honest and cloud providers connect with saved credentials

#### One-line summary
Makes Working indicators and session reconciliation truthful, connects Den providers from locally saved Desktop credentials, and publishes SOC 2 status.

#### Main changes
- Working indicators now stop when a run errors or the engine is unreachable, and show minutes past the first hour.
- Sessions reconcile more cleanly: completions are detected while you are elsewhere, queued composer messages send when a session is out of view, and archiving works from any workspace.
- Den cloud providers now connect using credentials saved locally on the Desktop, and Google Workspace retrieval is more resilient.
- The landing page shows Harness's SOC 2 badge and status, and web boot failures and Stripe webhook errors now reach Sentry.
- Remediated static-analysis security findings, isolated provider sync contexts, and improved internal test and release tooling.

#### Title
MCP connections become standard servers and desktop flows stay reliable

#### One-line summary
Exposes MCP connections as standard MCP servers while improving browser opening, dashboard discovery, Settings navigation, and enterprise sign-in validation.

#### Main changes
- MCP connections can now be exposed directly as standard MCP servers.
- Fixed browser.open_url so a blank initialize load no longer aborts it.

- Improved narrow-window Settings navigation, session naming, child permission requests, image lightboxes, tool groups, queued drafts, and session sidebar behavior.
- Added Automations flags to Helm starter examples, Google SSO and SCIM guidance, and safer SSO configuration validation.
