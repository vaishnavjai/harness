# Harness tests and test evidence

All executable coverage lives in [`specs/**/*.test.ts`](./specs) and imports
`test` from `@harness/testkit`. Tests that drive Electron, the web app, or another
app surface use `.e2e.test.ts`. Every world runs against the local Harness
core: the desktop, the Harness server and the pinned engines, with
deterministic local witnesses in place of external services.

## Paved path

Use the skills in this order:

1. `write-a-spec`
2. `run-tests`
3. `diagnose-a-red-run` when the run fails
4. `open-a-pr`; CI runs the changed specs on the PR head and publishes the evidence

Demo-driven features start from a world script plus a spec in `evals/specs`.

## Experimental verification dictionary

See [Verification dictionary](./verification-dictionary.md) for closed-set Jev
compilation, deterministic replay with zero model calls, the full 59-method
channel inventory, privacy boundaries, and offline/live benchmark instructions.
This opt-in compiler selects checked-in assertions; it is not an app-state judge.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| world | An executable TypeScript script that creates and holds concrete resources. |
| receipt | PID ownership metadata for a detached script world. |
| place | Where launched resources run: `local` or `daytona`. |
| witness | A deterministic provider stand-in that records what it saw. |
| fault | Declared misbehavior used to reproduce a failure condition. |
| surface | A drivable UI: `appWeb` (the app in headless Chrome) or `desktop` (Electron). |
| origin | Whether a resource is launched or attached. See below. |
| live | A spec that uses a real model provider with explicit consent; red can mean the provider, not the diff. |

### Resource ownership

The script's `AsyncDisposableStack` owns what the script creates and disposes it
in reverse order. Attached or shared resources expose handles whose disposers
release only script-owned additions, such as local port-forwards; they do
not stop or delete what they attach to. The rule is: **the stack owns what the script creates, not what it
attaches to.**

## Skills map

Skills own mechanics; this README owns the map and vocabulary.

| Task | Skill to load | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Author a spec | `write-a-spec` | Add executable coverage under `evals/specs`. |
| Run tests | `run-tests` | Run a selected spec; the CLI chooses and reports placement. |
| Failing or red run | `diagnose-a-red-run` | Classify a failure before changing code. |
| Missing secret or environment variable | `get-env-var` | Load a required team secret into the shell. |
| Drive local Electron via CDP | `browser-automation` | Explore or debug the local desktop surface. |
| Daytona setup or sandbox debugging | `daytona` | Repair the CLI, snapshots, sandboxes, or secrets volume. |
| Demo artifacts | `record-a-demo` | Capture supplementary screenshots or recordings. |

## Install and run

`evals/` is a standalone pnpm workspace so its tooling cannot affect product
installs or image builds.

```bash
pnpm --dir evals install
pnpm evals:pr
pnpm evals:e2e app-smoke
```

`pnpm --dir evals typecheck` (also `pnpm evals:typecheck`) type-checks every
spec, world, driver, script, and package under `evals/` and must exit 0 (run it
before pushing; the CI step lands separately). It compiles with the bundler resolution Vitest
uses and reports only diagnostics that belong to `evals/` (or to files the
config includes explicitly), because the `apps/` and `packages/` sources a spec pulls
in are compiled by their own projects with their own flags. Nothing inside
`evals/` is filtered: a spec that no longer matches the testkit API is red here.

### E2E CLI

Run the E2E lane with `pnpm evals:e2e [test-names...]`. Naming a test
auto-satisfies the opt-in flags declared in its source, but value-bearing
environment variables such as `HARNESS_EVAL_MODEL` are never auto-set. Vision
judging is deferred by default; add `--with-llm-vision` to judge inline. Use
`--local` to force isolated local resources, `--daytona` to require Daytona,
or `--publish --pr <number>` to judge and publish
existing evidence. Without a placement flag, the CLI probes Daytona auth and
prints `placement: <daytona|local> (<reason>)` for the placement asserted in the
runtime environment. `--local` and `--daytona` override inherited placement;
transport, engine, and surface selectors are never inferred as source opt-ins.

Registered cases select a concrete world and can select their engine without
raw environment variables. `ACT-01` and `MOBILE-CHAT-01` are fixed headless
app-web worlds. Use `pnpm evals:e2e --list` to see the registered cases. The legacy
`--surface` selector is migration validation only: it cannot change a declared
world's implementation, and selecting Electron for either case is rejected.

```bash
pnpm evals:e2e task-activity-shimmer --local --engine v1 --case ACT-01
pnpm evals:e2e v2-sessionless-first-send --daytona --engine v1 --case MOBILE-CHAT-01
```

A focused web case avoids legacy Electron suite preparation, but still
boots the real Vite app, server, engine, and Chrome; install dependencies first.
This fast path is not a guarantee for the duration of a first cold install.
Explicit `--local` placement cannot be overridden by source consent or inherited
Daytona settings. `--daytona` uses provided slot environment as advanced
configuration, runs one selected case per sandbox, and checks the immutable
ref/source guard before launch.

Under Daytona the spec files run from this checkout while the sandbox builds
`HARNESS_EVAL_REF` (default `dev`). The CLI resolves that ref against `origin`,
appends `ref=<ref>` to the placement line, and warns on stderr when it differs
from the runner `HEAD`; `--strict-ref` (or `HARNESS_EVAL_STRICT_REF=1`) turns
the warning into a failure before any sandbox is provisioned. Evidence records
both commits: `gitSha` is the runner checkout and `sandboxRef` is the ref the
sandbox built. To test a branch, push it and export
`HARNESS_EVAL_REF=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`.

`--case` filters Vitest by the registered literal case prefix. A passing result
means that selected case passed; other cases in the file are reported as not
run. A selected skip, unknown result, zero matches, or missing JSON report is
incomplete; any non-selected case that executes is a contract failure.
Daytona slot IDs and refs remain advanced environment configuration.

### Bounded world migration

The audited migration covers only `CONT-01` (`chatStreamContinuityWeb`) in
`specs/streamed-markdown-answer.e2e.test.ts` and `SWITCH-10`
(`sessionSwitchLatencyWeb`) in
`specs/live-tool-visible-after-session-switch.e2e.test.ts`. Each binding declares
`resources: { surfaces: ["appWeb"], services: ["mock"] }` and boots through
`seed.appWeb`, whose default is `headless: true`. Neither world reads surface
or headless environment selectors. CONT-01 tests ordinary app UI and has no
native variant.

Both cases assert the runtime user agent contains `HeadlessChrome`, that the
Electron bridge is absent, and that the app origin, server health, and selected
engine routes match the fixture. Source SHA metadata is recorded and checked
when available (required on Daytona); this is not a full source receipt or
proof of uncommitted source contents.

The other cases and legacy worlds in these mixed files, including
`streamedMarkdown`, `streamedToolHistory`, and the existing live-tool switching
setup, are untouched and explicitly deferred. Shared `worlds/chat.ts` and the
rest of the legacy world inventory are outside this bounded migration. Running
an entire mixed file still includes its legacy setup; selecting a migrated case
does not certify or migrate the other cases.

| Exit | Named test | Unfiltered E2E suite | Publish |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | Passed | Passed, or incomplete with expected skips | Published |
| `1` | Failed | Failed | Failed claims published, or publish failed |
| `2` | Incomplete because it skipped | Not used | Claims pending judgment |

See `run-tests` for environment requirements and the cold-boot verdict check.

Every `evals/specs/*.e2e.test.ts` file on disk runs in the E2E lane. To stop a
spec from running, delete it; history keeps the removed test available.

### Live lane

Live specs use a real model provider. Run one only by exact name, with explicit
consent and your own key, for example:

```bash
HARNESS_EVAL_LIVE_OPENAI=1 OPENAI_API_KEY=<key> pnpm evals:e2e live-stream-continuity --local --engine v1 --case CONT-01-live
```

Credentials alone never opt into inference, and they are never recorded as
evidence.

## Authoring contract

The spec boundary ratchet (`scripts/spec-boundary-ratchet.mjs`) rejects new
files that import product source (`../../apps|packages|ee`) or that never cross
a product boundary (`app()`, `chrome()`, `server()`, `spec.world()`, or a
world import); a file with no boundary is also called out for `node:fs` and
`node:child_process`. Its `specs/boundary-ratchet.baseline.json`
grandfathers legacy files and only shrinks. Cleanup deletes them, moves unit
tests next to their module, or folds their assertions into a journey spec.

- Import `test` from `@harness/testkit`.
- Name app-driving files `<slug>.e2e.test.ts`; app-less tests use `<slug>.test.ts`.
- Live specs use `<slug>.live.test.ts`, never run in PR/E2E suites, and require a consent environment variable.
- Acquire resources in dependency order with `needs()` → `server()` → `app()`.
- Drive user-visible behavior and assert observable outcomes. Backend, file,
  and process checks may witness side effects but do not replace the journey.
- Bound every wait and declare external requirements in `needs()` so missing
  dependencies skip with a named reason.
- Assert both positive and negative sides of identity or permission boundaries.

## Writing specs

New app-driving specs use `spec.world()` and four capability-restricted
channels. Import them only from `@harness/testkit`.

| Channel | Purpose | Allowed effects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seed` | Arrange the world | Create desktops, the web app, data, mocks, sessions, and faults; this is the only API/state write channel. |
| `user` | Act as a person | Trusted CDP mouse, keyboard, navigation, reload, visible assertions, screenshots, and vision checks. It cannot evaluate JS, fetch, or use app controls. |
| `agent` | Use the product automation rail | Explicit `window.__harnessControl` actions, including agent sends and session actions. |
| `probe` | Observe without changing state | Read text, composer/storage/hash/API/witness state, and poll with `eventually`. Probe API calls are GET-only. |

A world is an imperative async function. Resources created through `seed` are
owned by the fixture's `AsyncDisposableStack` and released in reverse order.
Worlds are per-test by default; `{ scope: "file" }` shares exactly the handles
the world returns. E2E files automatically need
`HARNESS_EVAL_E2E_TESTS=1`, and unmet needs skip before the world starts.

```ts
export async function emptySession(seed: Seed) {
  const workspacePath = seed.tmpPath("empty-session");
  const app = await seed.appWeb({ workspacePath });
  await seed.workspace(app, workspacePath);
  await seed.session(app);
  return { app };
}
```

Ordinary app UI authoring defaults to `seed.appWeb({ workspacePath })` (headless Chrome, the real
app, server, and engine). Bind the world's resources explicitly at `spec.world`:

```ts
const test = spec.world(emptySession, {
  resources: { surfaces: ["appWeb"], services: [] },
});
```

Use `seed.desktop()` only for a native capability a browser cannot prove, and
explain that capability in the binding's `nativeReason`, for example:

```ts
const nativeTest = spec.world(nativeFileDialog, {
  resources: {
    surfaces: ["desktop"],
    services: [],
    nativeReason: "Verify the operating-system file dialog opened through the Electron bridge.",
  },
});
```

Surfaces, services, and placement are separate: declare `mock` under
`services` when the world creates one; choose local or Daytona with the runner's
placement flags. For declared worlds, the resource
guard refuses an undeclared surface or service before launch, and a desktop
declaration requires a non-empty `nativeReason`. Undeclared legacy worlds are
temporarily allowed within the deferred migration scope; that compatibility is
not the authoring default.

`app` and `web` are conventional primary surface names. If the returned world
has one of them (or exactly one surface), channel calls use it by default;
otherwise bind explicitly with `user.on(surface)`, `agent.on(surface)`, or
`probe.on(surface)`.

Use `step(name, fn)` for a claim-sized frame. Steps may nest; failures are
recorded and rethrown, and a later attempted step is marked `not-reached`.
Every channel call and step automatically contributes a chronological evidence
trace and the body wrapper records the passed, failed, or skipped outcome.

The body call-order rule prevents accidental setup disguised as user behavior:
`seed.*` before the first `user.*` or `agent.*` act throws. Put that setup in the
world. Mid-flow seeding after an act is explicit and allowed; probes do not
change the ordering state.

`seed.evalIn()` (`[seed:raw]`) and `probe.eval()` (`[probe:raw]`) are migration
escape hatches. Both take type-checked browser callbacks and await promises automatically.
`probe.eval` accepts `{ timeoutMs?: number }` after either `(callback)` or
`(surface, callback)`. Raw JavaScript strings are rejected. New specs must not use them. The channel ratchet
records current legacy usage per E2E file and fails on increases or stale
baseline entries.

Before, composer reload coverage imported hosts, behaviors, CDP evaluation, and
evidence APIs directly. After, the journey is only:

```ts
const test = spec.world(emptySession, {
  resources: { surfaces: ["appWeb"], services: [] },
});
test("a draft survives reloads", async ({ user, probe, step }) => {
  await user.type("composer", "Keep this draft");
  const revision = await probe.storage("harness.session-drafts.v2", pickRevision);
  await step("draft survives three reloads", async () => {
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i += 1) {
      await user.reload();
      await user.see("composer", { editable: true, text: "Keep this draft" });
    }
  });
  expect(await probe.storage("harness.session-drafts.v2", pickRevision)).toBe(revision);
});
```

`"composer"` is the documented well-known target for the Lexical
`[contenteditable="true"][data-lexical-editor="true"]` editor. Other targets use
accessible name, role, label, placeholder, test ID, and optional `nth`; `text`
and `label` accept strings or regular expressions. A unique visible element
whose inner text starts with a string is the fallback for a non-exact text/name
match.

`user.type(target, text)` appends by default. Pass `{ replace: true }` to focus
with a real click, select all with the platform key chord, and replace the
current value. `user.see(target, { text })` compares contenteditable inner text
and accepts a string or regular expression. Clicks require center-point hit
testing; `{ hitTest: false }` is a last resort for an intentionally covered
target and still performs a trusted CDP click at that element's center.

`probe.dom(selector)` reads a fixed DOM snapshot: matching elements in document
order with text, focus and rectangles, plus viewport/document widths. It never
returns input values or accepts executable callbacks. Use it for geometry and
focus assertions after trusted `user.press("Tab")` actions, rather than raw eval.

`probe.connectState(app)` reads the
testkit's normalized desktop Connect state without exposing the raw helper to a
spec.

## Layers

Imports only point down: a layer may use lower layers, never a higher layer.
This is enforced by `pnpm --dir evals run lint:layers`.

| Layer | Contents | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | `@harness/matchers` | Turn supplied facts into pure findings; no I/O. |
| L1 | `@harness/cdp`, `@harness/labs` | Provide protocol and lab primitives; do not own journeys or test lifecycle. |
| L2 | `@harness/behaviors` | Provide framework-free actions and observations over narrow handles. |
| L3 | root `@harness/world` + `@harness/env` | The shared package owns script discovery, CLI receipts, and the headless-web surface; env provides concrete eval resources. Neither depends on Vitest. |
| L4 | `@harness/testkit` and `evals/bin/evals.mjs` | Adapt environments to specs, Vitest, and evidence. |

## Composable packages and diagnostics

The packages under [`packages/`](./packages) are independently consumable, but
executable coverage is always assembled as a test under `specs/`.

| Package | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| root `@harness/world` | script discovery, CLI lifecycle receipts, local state store, `hold()`, and headless-web surface |
| `@harness/env` | places and concrete desktop, app-web, and mock resources |
| `@harness/testkit` | thin Vitest adapter: fixture, needs/skip mapping, evidence bridging, and spec-facing re-exports |
| `@harness/cdp` | raw CDP client, targets, `Surface`, and `attachSurface` |
| `@harness/labs` | egress, release-feed, and mock-MCP labs |
| `@harness/hosts` | local and Daytona hosts and `resolveHost()` |
| `@harness/behaviors` | framework-free actions and observations over narrow handles |
| `@harness/matchers` | pure findings over facts, with no I/O |
| `@harness/test-evidence` | screenshot capture, visual validation, and ambient test-evidence recording used by testkit |
| `@harness/timeline` | timing spans for long test journeys |
| `@harness/test-artifacts` | index, render, and PR publication for completed test runs |

Because behaviors and matchers do not depend on a test context, they also power
the standalone diagnostic script at `evals/scripts/diagnose.mts`. It imports
only `@harness/behaviors` and `@harness/matchers` and can inspect a real
endpoint without creating test evidence.

## Worlds

A world is a plain executable TypeScript file under `worlds/`. Each script
creates concrete async resources in dependency order, registers them with a
native `AsyncDisposableStack`, and calls `hold()` after it is ready. Typical
resources are `app`, `mcpMock`, and `launchHeadlessWeb`.

Every checked-in script is guarded by `if (import.meta.main)`. Importing one is
therefore side-effect-free until a caller invokes an exported builder. Specs,
docs tooling, and the script entry point use those same builders; there is no
second lifecycle layer.

Useful ready-made scripts include `worlds/app-web.ts`, `worlds/preview-desktop.ts`,
and `worlds/desktop-prod-live.ts`. See `pnpm world list` for the complete current
set.

Detached scripts write PID ownership receipts to
`evals/results/.worlds/scripts/<name>.json`. A receipt records the script path,
PID, creation time, and non-secret outputs. It is lifecycle metadata, not a
recipe for recreating resources.

### World CLI

The root `pnpm world` command requires Node 24+. Its interactive lifecycle is:

```bash
pnpm world up app-web              # foreground; Ctrl-C disposes its stack
pnpm world up app-web --detach     # background; waits for its receipt
pnpm world up preview-desktop --detach --timeout 600000
pnpm world down app-web            # signal it and wait for native disposal
pnpm world list
pnpm world forget <name>
pnpm world help

# A path or the filename-derived name selects the same script.
pnpm world up ./worlds/dev-headless.ts

# Script-specific arguments must follow the separator.
pnpm world up dev-headless --detach -- --replace --keep-tokens
pnpm world up headless-prod-live -- --allow-shared-state
pnpm world up desktop-prod-live -- --allow-shared-state
```

The generic `up` options are only `--detach` and, with detached mode,
`--timeout <ms>`. Everything after `--` is passed unchanged to the selected
script. `down` sends the script a termination signal and waits while its
`AsyncDisposableStack` releases owned resources. `forget` removes receipt
metadata only; it does not stop the process. `help` and `list` discover
`worlds/*.ts`.

`desktop-prod-live` is a deliberately dangerous local-only mode. It launches
source Electron through `pnpm dev` with isolated Electron userData, app
identifier, Vite/CDP ports, and protocol registration, while resolving the
installed production `HARNESS_DATA_DIR` and channel-aware `OPENCODE_DB` only at
launch time. It never copies or symlinks those stores and does not seed a
workspace, session, or sign-in. Production may remain
running, but concurrent writes from production and dev are unsupported and may
corrupt state. Its parser requires exactly `--allow-shared-state`, after the
`world up` argument separator. Disposal stops only the source dev process and
does not delete shared stores.

`headless-prod-live` applies the same symbolic state selection to source Vite +
`harness-server` without Electron. Its production tokens, server state, config,
Harness data, and OpenCode database are resolved in place and never copied into
the receipt. It requires the same exact script argument and refuses remote
access, public hosts, and non-loopback host bindings.

## Recipes

### Drive the app

Import the script's builder, create one disposal stack, and call the builder.
Compose journeys from `@harness/behaviors`; executable coverage belongs in
`evals/specs`.

```ts
import { bootAppWebWorld } from "../../worlds/app-web.ts";

await using stack = new AsyncDisposableStack();
const outputs = await bootAppWebWorld(stack, { place: "local" });
```

### Provision a fresh setup

Compose the same concrete builders directly. The stack owns each resource added
with `use()` and disposes it in reverse order.

```ts
await using stack = new AsyncDisposableStack();
const desktop = stack.use(await app({ place, workspacePath: "/tmp/harness-demo" }));
```

### Reproduce a failure

Run the relevant script or exact spec again with the same explicit inputs.
Receipts cannot recreate a run; use their PID, script path, outputs, and paired
log only to inspect or stop the existing detached process.

## Ambient evidence and verdicts

The testkit fixture opens and closes a test-evidence recorder around each test.
Screenshots become test artifacts, visual validation records their expectations,
and assertion evidence carries witness assertions. Do not create or pass
recorder handles.

Report `Passed` only when every claim has observable evidence in the test run.
A failed assertion is `Failed`; missing requirements, tooling failure, or
missing test evidence is `Incomplete` or a named skip. A green suite containing
skips is not proof.

CI publishes. `PR change proof` runs every changed spec on the PR head and
`evidence-review` posts one sticky comment linking the report; nobody runs the
publisher by hand. `evals:e2e --publish` remains for that trusted CI path
only. Custom screenshots and recordings are supplementary and never determine
the pass/fail verdict.

## Daytona E2E tests

Run a selected test through the E2E CLI:

```bash
pnpm evals:e2e app-smoke
```

Without a placement flag, the CLI uses Daytona when `daytona snapshot list`
succeeds and local otherwise, then prints the placement and reason. `--daytona`
requires Daytona; `--local` forces local.

Use `--engine v1|v2` for a named spec. A registered `--case` selects its concrete
world; the migrated cases use headless app-web on either placement. Legacy cases
in files run without `--case` retain their existing environment-driven behavior.
The test-evidence header records the selected engine.

Use direct CDP tools only to explore or debug. Convert repeatable coverage into
a testkit test.

## CDP manual-debugging tools

The `opencode-chrome-devtools` plugin exposes these browser tools. Every call
takes `browser_url`; target-specific calls also use the selected target ID.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `browser_list` | list page targets on a CDP endpoint |
| `browser_navigate` | navigate a target |
| `browser_snapshot` | inspect the accessibility tree and stable UIDs |
| `browser_click` | click a snapshot UID |
| `browser_fill` | fill an input by UID |
| `browser_eval` | inspect state or run debugging JavaScript |
| `browser_screenshot` | capture a PNG checkpoint |

Use these calls for exploration and debugging, not as replacement verdict
evidence. Repeatable executable coverage belongs in a testkit test, where
observable assertions and validated screenshots are recorded as test evidence.

## Reserved names (not implemented)

These names are designed but not built. Do not attempt to use them:

- `attach.user({ secretRef })`
- `attach.sandbox(...)`
- `secretRef`; secrets will be named and resolved at start. Snapshots may carry
  secret references, never secret values.

## Daytona reference

### Ports

| Service | Port |
| --- | ---: |
| noVNC | 6080 |
| Vite HMR | 5173 |
| Electron CDP | 9825 |
| Artifacts | 8090 |

### Electron UI selectors

| Control | Stable selector/search | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings | `[data-testid="account-status-menu"]`, then `Settings` | `domains/session/sidebar/account-status-menu.tsx` |
| Back to app | button text `Back to app` | `domains/settings/shell/settings-shell.tsx` |
| New task | `button[aria-label="New task"]` | `domains/session/sidebar/app-sidebar.tsx` |
| Run task | button text `Run task` | `domains/session/surface/composer/composer.tsx` |
| Model selector | `button[aria-label="Change model"]` | `domains/session/surface/composer/composer.tsx` |
| Composer | `[contenteditable="true"][data-lexical-editor="true"]` | `domains/session/surface/composer/editor.tsx` |
| AI Providers | button text `AI Providers` | `domains/settings/shell/settings-page.tsx` |
| Connect provider | button text `Connect provider` | `domains/settings/pages/ai-view.tsx` |
| Provider search | `input[placeholder="Filter providers by name or ID"]` | `domains/connections/provider-auth/provider-auth-modal.tsx` |
| Manual key | button containing `Manually enter API Key` | `provider-auth-modal.tsx` |
| API key | `input[type="password"][placeholder="sk-..."]` | `provider-auth-modal.tsx` |
| Save key | button text `Save key` | `provider-auth-modal.tsx` |

### Lexical composer typing

```js
const editor = document.querySelector('[contenteditable="true"][data-lexical-editor="true"]')
editor.focus()
document.execCommand("selectAll", false, null)
document.execCommand("insertText", false, "YOUR PROMPT HERE")
```

### Type-checked browser code

Use the existing user/locator helpers for ordinary interaction. When an existing
probe needs browser-only logic, author a self-contained TypeScript callback:

```ts
const fits: boolean = await probe.eval(
  () => document.documentElement.scrollWidth <= window.innerWidth,
);
const count: number = await probe.eval(browserScript(
  (selector) => document.querySelectorAll(selector).length,
  ["[data-message-role=assistant]"],
));
```

Import `browserScript` from `@harness/testkit` in specs and `@harness/cdp` in
worlds and lower layers. It binds explicit serializable arguments; browser code
cannot capture test variables or imported runtime helpers. Return plain data,
not elements or functions. API JSON remains `unknown` where the contract is
unknown; validate it before relying on a shape.

For code that must run before navigation, worlds use
`addInitScript(client, browserScript(callback, [args]))`. Its `dispose()` and
`Symbol.asyncDispose` remove the registration for future documents; an observer
already running in the current page still needs its own cleanup.

`pnpm evals:check-browser` checks browser callback bodies, argument/result types,
closure captures (including imported aliases), and raw CDP execution bypasses.
It runs in the test-framework CI command. Unlike running a TypeScript test,
this invokes the TypeScript checker, scoped to browser callback bodies and the
CDP browser-script modules. `pnpm --dir evals typecheck` (see Install and run)
checks everything else under `evals/`; neither claims that the unrelated `apps/`
or `packages/` projects a spec imports compile under evals flags.
