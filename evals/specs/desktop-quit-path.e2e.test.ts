/**
 * A packaged enterprise desktop must actually exit when asked to quit, on every
 * teardown path, without tripping a Chromium CHECK.
 *
 * Released 0.18.42-0.18.46 failed both halves. A fresh, never-activated install
 * sent SIGTERM stayed alive with no window until it was SIGKILLed: its
 * `before-quit` teardown had nothing to stop, so `app.quit()` re-entered
 * Electron's `Browser::Quit()` from inside the `before-quit` emit and the outer
 * call reset `is_quitting_`. Instances whose app bundle had already been removed
 * from disk crashed with SIGTRAP instead (`ElectronBrowserClient::
 * AppendExtraCommandLineSwitches`, `CHECK_EQ(program, child_path)`), because the
 * quit path navigated the window to a data: URL and so spawned a renderer.
 *
 * The bound sits above the 10 s teardown deadline in quit-sequence.mjs (a quit
 * that arrives while the local runtime is still booting waits for that boot
 * behind the lifecycle queue, which the deadline caps) and far below the
 * failure, where the process never exits at all. The fix itself quits in
 * ~200 ms once the runtime is idle.
