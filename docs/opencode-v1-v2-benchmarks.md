# OpenCode v1 vs v2 benchmarks

This note records two benchmark lanes run on the same machine with the same
deterministic witness provider. All durations are milliseconds. Medians and
ranges below are calculated directly from the sample arrays in:

- `evals/bench/results/2026-08-31-m3max-engines.json`
- `evals/bench/results/2026-08-31-m3max-app-v1.json`
- `evals/bench/results/2026-09-01-m3max-app-v2.json`

## What was asked and what each lane answers

The original questions map to the measured scenarios as follows.

| User question | App-perspective metric | Engine-perspective metric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time to first session, first load, and first send | `cold_boot_to_composer`, `first_send_cold` | `boot_ready`, `spawn_to_first_api_ok`, `first_prompt_cold` |
| Time to a ready session | `new_session_ready` | `session_create` |
| Workspace switch speed | `workspace_switch.aToB`, `workspace_switch.bToA` | `directory_switch` |
| Message response time | `message_rtt.userRendered`, `firstToken`, `complete` | `message.accepted`, `witness_first_byte`, `first_token`, `complete` |
| Very long message and compaction | `long_message`, `uiCompactionAvailable` | `long.*`, `compaction` |

### Lane A: app perspective, pure CDP

Lane A runs the real Harness Electron app on the v1 engine. It drives the app
only through the UI: CDP `Input.insertText` types into the real composer and
the real controls are clicked.

The witness provider is provisioned by a file on disk before workspace
creation. The benchmark chooses its model through the picker UI. There is zero
API seeding of workspaces, sessions, messages, or model selection.

This is the lane that answers what a Harness user sees today.

### Lane B: engine vs engine

Lane B compares the v1 engine, `opencode` 1.18.18, with the v2 engine,
`opencode2` 0.0.0-beta-18707. It sends identical user-shaped sequences over
each engine's own HTTP dialect and routes both engines to the same kind of
witness.

This isolates the engine boundary from Harness renderer and Electron costs.

### Why the pure-CDP v2 app lane arrived through the adapter

Harness's UI now routes chat through v2 behind the preview flag and the
**Route chat through OpenCode v2** toggle from
`feat/opencode-v2-chat-routing`. Lane A was rerun in that mode with
`HARNESS_BENCH_ENGINE=v2`, using the server-to-engine dialect adapter.

Historically, the v2 stack's own drivable surface was not a substitute. Its web
UI, bundled in the `opencode2` binary, crashed on `/new-session` with:

```text
Error: TitlebarRight must be used within TitlebarRightProvider
```

That failure was reproduced through CDP in Chrome 152 on 2026-08-30 with both
0.0.0-beta-18707 and 0.0.0-dev-18710. A narrow-viewport layout crashed the same
way. The older 0.0.0-beta-17823 home screen never opened a session view.

Building the v2 desktop app from source would have benchmarked a different app,
not the proposed engine swap inside Harness. That is why the app lane arrived
through Harness's adapter rather than through the v2 web or desktop UI.

## Method

### Deterministic witness

Both lanes use a local HTTP witness provider. It streams exactly 20 tokens at
20 ms pacing, which imposes a 400 ms floor on completion. Usage is fixed.

The engine lane gives v1 and v2 separate API keys and asserts that every
request carries the correct lane key, model, and nonempty prompt. This catches
cross-lane traffic. The app lane similarly asserts its app-only key and model.

### Samples and machine

- Iterations: N=5.
- Exception: `first_prompt_cold` is intentionally one cold sample per engine.
- Reported values: median with minimum-maximum range.
- Platform: darwin arm64.
- Processor: Apple M3 Max, 16 CPUs.
- Memory: 48 GB.
- Node: v24.15.0.
- Lane B API polling resolution: 25 ms.
- Lane A UI polling resolution: 50 ms, from `pollResolutionMs`.
- Lane A app commit: `8d8d0105fd9e5bea4b7ff254833ee649b604e691`.

### Important cold-boot qualification

**Lane A runs a DEV BUILD: a Vite development server plus Electron dev. Its
cold-boot timings are not comparable to packaged-app startup.**

Each cold sample uses a fresh profile and workspace. Warm scenarios run in the
last cold instance only. The first cold iteration also pays first-compile cost,
which is visible in its higher sample.

### Metric boundaries

Lane B boundaries are:

- `boot_ready`: process spawn start until the managed engine reports ready; v2
  is additionally health-gated.
- `spawn_to_first_api_ok`: the same process spawn start through the first
  successful session-list response.
- `session_create`: immediately before the create request through a successful
  response containing a session ID.
- `first_prompt_cold`: immediately before the first prompt call through the
  message list containing the final witness token.
- `message.accepted`: prompt timer start through prompt admission response.
- `message.witness_first_byte`: prompt timer start until the witness receives
  the request.
- `message.first_token`: prompt timer start until a 25 ms message-list poll
  sees the witness nonce and `token 1`.
- `message.complete`: prompt timer start until a message-list poll sees the
  final witness token.
- `directory_switch`: immediately before listing a never-seen directory through
  that list and the first successful session creation in that directory.
- `long.*`: the message boundaries above, using an exact 200,000-character
  prompt.
- `compaction`: immediately before v1 `summarize` or v2 `compact` through a
  polled completed compaction record and a witnessed provider request.

Lane A boundaries are:

- `appInteractive`: desktop launch start until the desktop harness returns an
  interactive app.
- `workspaceReady`: that same launch start through UI workspace creation and
  selection.
- `composerReady`: that same launch start until the composer is editable and
  the Run task control is visible.
- `first_send_cold`: after untimed model selection, Run task click through the
  rendered final witness token and disappearance of the session loading
  indicator.
- `new_session_ready`: New task click until a distinct session route and
  surface exist, with an editable composer and visible Run task control.
- `message.userRendered`: Run task click until the exact new user turn appears.
- `message.firstToken`: the same click until `token 1` appears in the latest
  assistant turn.
- `message.complete`: the same click until the final token and witness nonce
  appear and the loading indicator is absent.
- `workspace_switch`: session-row click until the target workspace and session
  surface match and its composer is typable.
- `long.insertMs`: immediately before CDP `Input.insertText` until the composer
  contains the exact long payload; its other fields use the prepared-send
  boundaries above.

Timings are data, not performance assertions. The specs assert completion,
exact payload handling, workspace isolation, and witness fidelity only.

### Reproduction

Lane A runs with `OPENCODE_PURE=true` (plugins disabled) because it measures engine and UI latency rather than external-plugin dependency bootstrap time.

```sh
HARNESS_BENCH_ITERATIONS=5 pnpm evals:pr specs/bench-opencode-engines.test.ts
HARNESS_BENCH_ITERATIONS=5 HARNESS_EVAL_E2E_TESTS=1 pnpm --dir evals exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts --project e2e specs/bench-harness-app-v1.e2e.test.ts
```

Set `HARNESS_BENCH_RESULTS_DIR` to retain the generated JSON files.

## Lane B results: engine vs engine (medians, N=5)

Delta is v2 minus v1. Negative means v2 completed this boundary sooner.
`first_prompt_cold` has one sample rather than five.

| Scenario | v1 median (min-max) | v2 median (min-max) | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `boot_ready` | 540 (526-565) | 516 (511-779) | -24 |
| `spawn_to_first_api_ok` | 683 (664-706) | 520 (514-787) | -163 |
| `session_create` | 7 (3-9) | 55 (49-119) | +48 |
| `first_prompt_cold` | 3494 (3494-3494) | 4502 (4502-4502) | +1008 |
| `message.accepted` | 4 (4-6) | 3 (2-3) | -1 |
| `message.witness_first_byte` | 11 (10-18) | 9 (9-10) | -2 |
| `message.first_token` | 447 (445-480) | 516 (491-546) | +69 |
| `message.complete` | 452 (447-481) | 517 (494-547) | +65 |
| `directory_switch` | 13 (10-21) | 49 (49-61) | +36 |
| `long.accepted` | 6 (5-12) | 14 (13-21) | +8 |
| `long.witness_first_byte` | 25 (17-51) | 10 (10-18) | -15 |
| `long.complete` | 487 (465-543) | 525 (514-537) | +38 |
| `compaction` | 469 (451-500) | 452 (446-480) | -17 |

### Interpretation

- **Boot to usable API:** v2 is faster on `spawn_to_first_api_ok`. This is a
  single daemon with health-gated readiness, measured from spawn through the
  first successful list call.
- **Session creation:** v1's 7 ms median is effectively in-memory-scale here;
  v2's 55 ms includes durable SQLite and location-graph work. Both are
  imperceptible beside UI session setup.
- **Directory switch:** v1 wins the measured first-list-plus-create boundary.
  This needs a prominent laziness caveat: v1 defers real instance/provider cost,
  and its cold cost appears in `first_prompt_cold`. V2 pays a bounded `LayerMap`
  location build during first touch.
- **Cold first prompt:** v1 npm-installs `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` at first
  provider use; this is real product behavior. V2 bundles the compatible
  provider, yet its cold first prompt is higher in this run. **Hypothesis, not a
  measured explanation:** catalog/plugin generation settling plus the model-read
  gate on the first location account for some of that result.
- **Message dispatch:** witness arrival is about 10 ms in both lanes, so wire
  dispatch is effectively immediate.
- **Completion:** against the 400 ms witness pacing floor, median overhead is
  52 ms for v1 and 117 ms for v2.
- **First-token caveat:** Lane B `first_token` is when a message-list poll sees
  persisted text. It is not user-perceived streaming. Harness receives push
  events; Lane A measures a 92 ms v1 user-visible first token.
- **Compaction:** v1 `summarize` and v2 `compact` are witness-served and nearly
  equal on this boundary. Both are verified to reach the provider with their
  lane-specific key.
- **Overall:** at user-perceptible scales, warm engine message flows are within
  about 10% in this run. V2's case is architectural rather than raw latency:
  [no-reload provider injection](opencode-v2-parallel-lane.md#providers-on-v2-why-no-reload-is-needed),
  durable sessions, and one daemon for many directories.

## Lane A results: Harness app on v1, pure CDP (medians, N=5)

### Cold boot to composer: DEV BUILD, not packaged startup

| Metric | Median (min-max) |
| --- | ---: |
| `appInteractive` | 27089 (27022-36513) |
| `workspaceReady` | 38536 (38489-51020) |
| `composerReady` | 38537 (38490-51020) |

Iteration 1 is higher because it includes first compilation. Do not use this
table to predict packaged-app startup.

### Session and regular message flow

| Metric | Median (min-max) |
| --- | ---: |
| `first_send_cold.complete` | 2885 (2325-3583) |
| `new_session_ready` | 355 (335-403) |
| `message_rtt.userRendered` | 76 (75-83) |
| `message_rtt.firstToken` | 92 (88-133) |
| `message_rtt.complete` | 506 (490-523) |
| `workspace_switch.aToB` | 107 (97-133) |
| `workspace_switch.bToA` | 93 (89-132) |

A new prompt-ready session takes about 355 ms. Workspace restoration is about
100 ms. The first witness token is visible about 92 ms after clicking Run task.

### Exact 200,000-character message

| Metric | Median (min-max) |
| --- | ---: |
| `long_message.insertMs` | 43 (42-50) |
| `long_message.userRendered` | 108 (94-124) |
| `long_message.firstToken` | 167 (131-167) |
| `long_message.complete` | 540 (524-552) |

The 200,000-character CDP insertion itself takes 43 ms. Compared with the
regular-message medians, the long turn adds 32 ms to user render, 75 ms to
first token, and 34 ms to completion. In practical terms, the 200 KB paste adds
roughly 40-70 ms around the normal round trip, with the exact observed boundary
deltas stated above.

`uiCompactionAvailable=false`: Harness has no user-facing compact or summarize
control in this UI today. Engine-side compaction is covered in Lane B.

## Lane A results: Harness app on v2 (adapter preview), pure CDP (medians, N=5)

Delta is app on v2 minus app on v1. Negative means v2 completed this boundary
sooner.

| Metric | App on v1 median (min-max) | App on v2 median (min-max) | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `cold_boot_to_composer.appInteractive` | 27089 (27022-36513) | 20100 (19217-22136) | -6989 |
| `cold_boot_to_composer.workspaceReady` | 38536 (38489-51020) | 31499 (26839-35337) | -7037 |
| `cold_boot_to_composer.composerReady` | 38537 (38490-51020) | 31499 (26840-35338) | -7038 |
| `cold_boot_to_composer.appReadinessMs` | 7025 (6821-7690) | 5075 (4284-6456) | -1950 |
| `first_send_cold.complete` | 2885 (2325-3583) | 602 (581-649) | -2283 |
| `new_session_ready` | 355 (335-403) | 291 (183-396) | -64 |
| `message_rtt.userRendered` | 76 (75-83) | 588 (568-636) | +512 |
| `message_rtt.firstToken` | 92 (88-133) | 589 (569-640) | +497 |
| `message_rtt.complete` | 506 (490-523) | 589 (569-641) | +83 |
| `workspace_switch.aToB` | 107 (97-133) | 170 (151-438) | +63 |
| `workspace_switch.bToA` | 93 (89-132) | 127 (98-142) | +34 |
| `long_message.insertMs` | 43 (42-50) | 57 (55-118) | +14 |
| `long_message.userRendered` | 108 (94-124) | 589 (570-716) | +481 |
| `long_message.firstToken` | 167 (131-167) | 592 (571-718) | +425 |
| `long_message.complete` | 540 (524-552) | 593 (572-718) | +53 |

### Interpretation

- **First send cold:** v2 takes 602 ms versus v1's 2885 ms, about 4.8x
  faster to the first-ever reply. V2 needs no runtime npm provider install;
  v1 installs `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` on first use.
- **New session ready:** v2 takes 291 ms versus v1's 355 ms.
- **Streaming gap (v0 finding):** on v2, `userRendered`, `firstToken`, and
  `complete` are approximately equal in every iteration, at roughly 570-640
  ms. The adapter currently renders complete turns rather than incremental
  tokens. V1 renders the user message at about 76 ms, the first token at about
  92 ms, and completion at about 506 ms. **Hypothesis:** the adapter's
  `promptAsync` performs a model-switch round trip before the prompt POST,
  delaying the optimistic user render. **Hypothesis:** delta events lack an
  established part anchor until the cumulative `part.updated` at `text.ended`,
  so token deltas do not paint incrementally. This is the top adapter follow-up;
  engine-side completion is equivalent (Lane B: 452 ms versus 517 ms over a
  400 ms pacing floor).
- **Workspace switch:** v2 takes about 170 ms A→B and 127 ms B→A versus v1's
  107 ms and 93 ms, respectively. It is slightly slower. **Hypothesis:** extra
  preview-status and lane checks account for part of the difference.
- **Cold boot:** the lanes are comparable and dev-build-dominated. The dev-build
  warning above applies to both; these values do not predict packaged startup.
- **Setup asymmetry:** v2 mode provisions the witness through the runtime
  provider path, mirrored to the sidecar, and enables the preview flag through
  the API as untimed scaffolding. All measured interactions remain pure CDP in
  both app lanes.

## Answers to the five questions

| Question | Metric today: v1 app and engine | V2 preview app and engine | Likely user-visible change after adoption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First session, load, and send | DEV composer ready 38537 ms; cold first send 2885 ms; engine API usable 683 ms | DEV composer ready 31499 ms; cold first send 602 ms; API usable 520 ms; cold first engine prompt 4502 ms | Packaged startup must be measured separately; first send is about 4.8x faster because v2 avoids the runtime provider install |
| Ready session | App ready 355 ms; engine create 7 ms | App ready 291 ms; engine create 55 ms | The measured v2 preview is 64 ms faster at the app boundary |
| Workspace switch | 107 ms A→B and 93 ms B→A; unseen-directory engine touch 13 ms | 170 ms A→B and 127 ms B→A; unseen-directory touch 49 ms | Preview app revisits are slightly slower, as is first directory touch |
| Message response | User visible 76 ms, first token 92 ms, complete 506 ms; engine complete 452 ms | User visible 588 ms, first token 589 ms, complete 589 ms; engine complete 517 ms | Completion remains close, but the preview adapter currently paints complete turns instead of streaming incrementally |
| Long message and compaction | Exact 200000 chars insert in 43 ms and complete in 540 ms; no UI compaction control; engine summarize 469 ms | Exact 200000 chars insert in 57 ms and complete in 593 ms; engine compact 452 ms; compaction unsupported in the preview adapter because it has no UI control | Long-message completion is close at this pacing floor; compaction remains engine-only |

V2 can apply provider changes without reloading the engine, reflected in the
much faster cold first send. Warm engine completion remains broadly equivalent,
but the preview adapter's lack of incremental painting is a clear user-visible
regression. Session create adds about 50 ms engine-side while the app's new-task
boundary is 64 ms faster; workspace revisits are slightly slower.

## Follow-ups

- Fix incremental streaming in the v2 adapter, including part anchoring and
  optimistic user render, then re-measure `message_rtt`.
- Report the `/new-session` web UI crash upstream against the anomalyco/opencode
  v2 branch, including the exact provider error and affected builds above.
- Per-engine app numbers still need to be rerun on packaged builds.
- N=5 on one machine is directional evidence, not a population study. Treat
  single-digit-millisecond deltas as noise. The 400 ms pacing floor dominates
  completion metrics by design.
