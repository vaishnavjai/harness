# Skill: Run Tests

## Run the landable tree

- Check out the exact PR head that will land. After any rebase or cherry-pick,
  discard the old verdict and run again.
- Run one test at a time so each failure and ambient test evidence has one owner.

## Choose the execution environment

```bash
pnpm evals:e2e <slug>
pnpm evals:pr specs/<name>.test.ts
```

The CLI prints the placement and reason; copy that line into the report. Use
`--local` only when the user asks for local. `--daytona` requires Daytona. Never
switch lanes to turn a red Daytona run green.

## Prepare local fallback

```bash
pnpm --filter @harness/types build
```

- Worlds run against the local MIT core only: no MySQL, Redis or Docker is needed.
- If the checkout path contains spaces, set `HARNESS_EVAL_SURFACES_DIR` to a
  space-free path before E2E tests. node-gyp and electron-rebuild require it.

## Choose one lane

- Run one app-less PR-lane test:

```bash
pnpm evals:pr specs/<name>.test.ts
```

- Run one app-driving E2E test:

```bash
pnpm evals:e2e <name>
```

- The CLI owns placement and prints `placement: <daytona|local> (<reason>)`.

## Match the runtime

Check what runtime the changed code ships on before trusting a green run.
`apps/server` tests run on Bun; Desktop runs that same code on Electron's
Node (undici). If the change touches fetch, streams, signals, GC, or timers,
run it on the shipping runtime too:

```bash
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 apps/desktop/node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron --expose-gc <script>
```

A green run on the wrong runtime is not evidence.

## Read the verdict

- Record the exact command, exit code, and passed/failed/skipped counts.
- Report each skip as `skipped — needs: X`; never call it passed. A green command
  containing skips makes the overall verdict `Incomplete`.
- Use `Passed`, `Incomplete`, or `Failed` for the overall result.

## Iterate, then cold-boot

- While iterating, keep a world running with `pnpm world up <name> --detach`.
- Before declaring `Passed`, tear it down and cold-boot the spec on the same commit.
- Inject secrets with `infisical run --silent --`; never print or echo values.
