/**
 * Desired-state reconciler for the organization Connect policy.
 *
 * The Den desktop config carries one desired Connect switch
 * (`connectEnabled`). The local Harness server owns the actual state and is
 * a moving target: every (re)start is a new *runtime generation*, and a
 * policy delivered to one generation says nothing about the next one.
 *
 * This module reconciles `actual = desired` per target generation instead of
 * retrying a fixed number of times:
 *
 * - The desired value is one normalized tuple: the Connect switch plus the
 *   revision (active organization) it came from.
 * - The target identity combines the resolved runtime connection (base URL +
 *   host token) with the desktop runtime's per-start generation, so it
 *   changes whenever the runtime restarts or the workspace switches to a
 *   different local server lifetime.
 * - Success is recorded as the tuple (target key, desired value, revision).
 *   A new generation never matches the recorded key, so an unchanged policy
 *   is reapplied after a restart.
 * - Every `setDesired` or `notifyTargetChanged` call starts a new epoch.
 *   In-flight attempts from an older epoch are invalidated: their results are
 *   discarded and never recorded against the current target.
 * - Transient failures retry with bounded backoff while the same target
 *   remains relevant. When the schedule is exhausted the reconciler parks in
 *   a sanitized `stalled` state; the next desired-state or target-generation
 *   observation re-arms it. There is no free-running timer loop.
 *
 * Applying the policy is idempotent (a PUT of the desired switch), so
 * re-reconciling an already-converged target performs one cheap target
 * resolution and no policy request.
