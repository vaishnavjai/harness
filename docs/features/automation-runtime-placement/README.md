# Creation-owned Automation runtime placement

## Outcome

The surface that creates an Automation owns its execution placement for the
Automation's lifetime:

- Desktop creation produces a `desktop` Automation and continues to use the
  authenticated desktop runner introduced by the existing Automations work.
- Harness Web and Cloud Chat creation produce a `cloud` Automation. Den
  schedules the occurrence, wakes the owner's existing Harness Cloud container
  when it is stopped, and runs a native Harness thread headlessly inside that
  container.

Desktop and Harness Web share one Automations surface in the app: the same
list, editor, detail, run history, receipts, and in-chat proposal card. The
runtime only decides the placement of what that surface creates, and the free
Zen starter model stays a published-Desktop exception. The desktop runner
bridge never registers from a browser runtime.

Den's dashboard "My Automations" page is a monitor, not an authoring surface.
It groups Den-scheduled work by attention (running, needs attention,
scheduled, paused), shows receipts and Workflow results, and links each
Automation to the surface that manages it: Harness Web for Cloud placement,
the desktop app for Desktop placement. Cancelling an in-flight run is its only
operational control. A Workflow's "Automate" action deep-links into the
Harness Web editor with the exact Workflow version pinned.

Both surfaces read the same Den Automation and run history. Placement is shown
on list cards and receipts, but it is not an editable setting. Moving execution
between Desktop and Cloud requires creating a new Automation on that surface.

## Cloud lifecycle

A Cloud agent run reserves and persists its worker, workspace, native thread,
and deterministic user-message identity before it submits the prompt. Lease
recovery reattaches to that thread and observes-or-submits that exact message
instead of starting duplicate work. Den heartbeats the run while it waits,
requires an observed idle state after forwarding cancellation, records native
assistant/tool events and usage, and keeps active Cloud runs out of idle-stop
selection. Run deadlines include container wake-up and request admission.

Cloud creation requires the current owner to have an existing per-user Cloud
worker and an authorized model. It does not silently allocate a new Cloud
environment. A stopped worker is valid and is woken at execution time; a
missing or failed runtime is recorded as a durable failure and moves the
Automation to needs-attention. Timeouts are terminal receipts rather than
automatic retries because an agent may already have produced external side
effects; the user can inspect the native run and choose Run now explicitly.
Runtime readiness polling retains its pre-existing 120-second cap and terminal,
non-retryable outcome; signed-preview routing does not add another queued attempt.

Before prompt admission, Den probes and repairs the worker's persisted
`harness-cloud` MCP registration for the selected model. A missing Connect
configuration or model projection becomes durable needs-attention rather than
a headless run that silently lacks the user's connected services.

The native thread client uses both the collaborator token and the internal
host credential when it talks directly to the resolved Cloud runtime. No provider
credential or worker token is copied into the Automation receipt.

## Relationship to Workflow Automations

Workflow Automations from the Workflow Artifacts work remain Cloud-owned
and keep their existing Den Code Mode executor. This feature adds ordinary
agent actions as a second Cloud execution kind; it does not change Script
snapshot validation or artifact result retention.

## Verification boundary

Focused tests cover the Cloud-only MCP creation contract, deterministic prompt
admission, terminal errors, cancellation observation, dual worker credentials,
Cloud wake/idle lifecycle behavior, runtime-specific agent guidance, and
cross-surface execution labels. The testkit acceptance tape verifies that the
Den monitor lists Den-scheduled Automations without any create, edit, state,
run-now, or archive control and routes management to Harness Web or Desktop.
Source-contract tests pin the shared app surface: one deployment gate for both
runtimes, runtime-derived placement on create, and the desktop-only runner.

The deployment-shaped Daytona journey—stop a real user's container, let a due
occurrence wake it, execute against live model and Connect configuration, then
observe idle shutdown again—remains required for the production rollout and
merge decision. It is intentionally not claimed by local or mocked proof.
