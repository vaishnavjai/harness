 * The path existing enterprise customers take after an update: the bootstrap
 * already carries an activation stamp, so the activation gate must step aside
 * and the routes behind it must mount. The seeded Den is a closed local port,
 * so this holds with no network at all; the sign-in surface it lands on reads
 * its heading from the bootstrap, not from Den. Required sign-in is a property
 * of the enterprise build, independent of the suspended desktop policies.
 *
 * This is the activated half of a pair: packaged-first-launch boots the same
 * enterprise artifact with no bootstrap and requires the activation gate
 * heading, so a gate that always stepped aside would fail there. packaged-smoke
 * runs both against one binary.
