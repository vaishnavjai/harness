# Skill: release

Cut a Harness release. The "Release App" workflow
(`.github/workflows/release-macos-aarch64.yml`) builds, signs, and publishes
the desktop app assets on the GitHub release. Full runbook:
`docs/RELEASING.md`.

**Versions live in git tags only.** Every committed `package.json` holds the
permanent `0.0.0-dev` placeholder; CI stamps the tag-derived version into the
workspace at build time (`scripts/release/stamp-version.mjs`). A release makes
**zero commits to this repo** — no bump commit, no backfill PR, no packaging
PR.

A release is **done when the run is green and the GitHub release is published**
(not a draft) — never when the tag is created.

---

## Before you tag: open fix PRs and fork PRs

Run this before `release:cut` or any manual tag. It exists because a fork PR
carrying the exact fix for a blank-window-on-launch regression sat open for a
day before the affected version was tagged (incident 2026-09-09): fork PRs
never receive Warden clearance (`warden.yml` skips them and
`warden-clearance.yml` requires `head_repository == repository`), so nothing
surfaces them until a human looks.

List, against `dev`, every open PR opened since the previous stable tag whose
title or body matches `fix(app)|crash|blank|white screen|regression|first
launch`, plus every open fork PR created or updated in that window:

```bash
export R=vaishnavjai/harness
PREV=$(gh release list -R $R --exclude-drafts --exclude-pre-releases --limit 1 --json tagName --jq '.[0].tagName')
SINCE=$(gh release view "$PREV" -R $R --json createdAt --jq '.createdAt')
echo "previous tag $PREV created $SINCE"
gh pr list -R $R --state open --base dev --limit 300 --search "sort:created-asc" \
  --json number,title,body,isCrossRepository,createdAt,updatedAt,url \
  | jq -r --arg since "$SINCE" '.[]
      | select((.createdAt >= $since
                and ((.title + " " + .body) | test("fix\\(app\\)|crash|blank|white screen|regression|first launch"; "i")))
               or (.isCrossRepository and .updatedAt >= $since))
      | "#\(.number)\(if .isCrossRepository then " [FORK]" else "" end) \(.title) \(.url)"'
```

Then the fork backlog: open fork PRs of any age describing a crash or
startup failure. Scan the titles; a match for the bug class you are shipping
(or any blank/white-screen/first-launch fix) blocks the same way.

```bash
gh pr list -R $R --state open --base dev --limit 300 \
  --json number,title,body,isCrossRepository,url \
  | jq -r '.[] | select(.isCrossRepository
      and ((.title + " " + .body) | test("crash|blank|white screen|first launch|regression"; "i")))
      | "#\(.number) \(.title) \(.url)"'
```

For every PR listed, decide one of:

- **Land it first** — review it (fork PRs: `review-a-contributor-pr` skill),
  merge to `dev`, then tag.
- **Ship anyway** — the release goes out without it. This is only allowed as
  an explicit, recorded decision: paste the list of PR numbers, who decided,
  and the one-line reason into the release notes PR that `changelog.yml`
  opens after publish (`docs(changelog): release notes for vX.Y.Z`, branch
  `automation/changelog-vX.Y.Z-*`), under a `Known open fixes` heading. If
  the notes PR has not appeared yet, put the same text in the GitHub release
  body (`gh release edit vX.Y.Z -R $R --notes-file ...`) and move it when the
  PR opens.
- **Not a fix / not relevant** — say so in the same list; a false positive
  still gets one line, so the next release does not re-triage it silently.

An empty list is also recorded (`Known open fixes: none matched`). Tagging
with a non-empty list and no recorded decision is the failure mode this step
prevents; do not proceed.

---

## Cut a release (default path)

```bash
pnpm release:cut            # dispatches Release App with bump=patch
pnpm release:cut minor      # or major
pnpm release:cut --version 0.19.0
pnpm release:cut:watch      # same as release:cut, then tails the run
```

Equivalent by hand:

```bash
gh workflow run "Release App" --repo vaishnavjai/harness -f bump=patch
```

The run resolves the next version from existing `v*` tags, creates the tag on
`origin/dev` HEAD, verifies it (`scripts/release/verify-tag.mjs`: stable
format + strictly greater than every other stable tag), stamps the version
into the CI workspace, builds all 18 electron matrix legs, publishes npm +
Daytona + AUR, and flips the draft release public.

The tag ref is created via REST with the org-owned **diff-warden** app token
(a `v*` ruleset bypass actor; `WARDEN_APP_ID` + `WARDEN_PRIVATE_KEY` in the
`warden-clearance` environment). The app's tag retriggers the workflow; that duplicate run is skipped by an
actor guard. If the tag push is rejected, the run fails with instructions —
fix the ruleset bypass or fall back to a manual admin tag push.

## Tag-first (expedited, admins only)

To release a commit that is not yet reviewed onto `dev` (incident response),
push the tag manually — the tag names exactly the code that ships:

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z <sha>
git push origin vX.Y.Z     # v* ruleset grants admins bypass
```

The Expedited Release Audit workflow opens a post-hoc review issue when the
tagged commit is not on `dev`. Never push `dev` directly or bypass its branch
rules.

---

## Watch

```bash
gh run list --repo vaishnavjai/harness --workflow "Release App" --limit 1
gh run watch <run-id> --repo vaishnavjai/harness --exit-status --interval 90
```

Publishing is gated on the electron matrix, electron assets, and npm publish.
`Publish AUR` (continue-on-error) and `Build + Push Daytona Snapshot` are
**non-blocking channels**: their failures don't stop the release — rerun the
workflow with the same tag once the channel recovers.

**Rerun an existing tag (recovery)** — transient failures, or replaying
non-blocking channels:

```bash
gh workflow run "Release App" --repo vaishnavjai/harness -f tag=vX.Y.Z
```

If the release is already **published**, a recovery run skips every desktop
build leg and the updater-manifest merge; it replays only npm, AUR, and
Daytona. Rebuilding re-signs the installers, and a run that fails before
`publish-release` would leave `latest*.yml` pointing at bytes that no longer
exist. Every auto-update then fails with `sha512 checksum mismatch` (v0.18.52).
Ship new desktop bytes as the next patch.

Recovery runs skip tag creation and monotonicity, build source pinned to the
tag, and pick up workflow-file fixes from `dev` automatically (the workflow
definition runs from the dispatched ref; only the checked-out sources are
pinned to the tag).

**If the run fails before the release is published:** land the fix on `dev`
via a normal protected-branch PR and cut the next patch (`pnpm release:cut`).
Only delete/recreate a tag after verifying the GitHub release is still
draft-only:

```bash
git push --delete origin vX.Y.Z
```

---

## Verify

```bash
gh release view vX.Y.Z --repo vaishnavjai/harness --json assets --jq '.assets[].name'
```

Expect the app assets (`harness-<platform>-X.Y.Z.*`, `latest*.yml` updater
manifests), including:

- `harness-mac-arm64-X.Y.Z.dmg`
- `harness-mac-x64-X.Y.Z.dmg`
- `harness-win-x64-X.Y.Z.exe`

The desktop updater 404s on `latest*.yml` until the release is published —
that error in a running app during the build window is expected and
self-heals. Spot-check a download URL resolves (302 to release-assets CDN):

```bash
curl -sI "https://github.com/vaishnavjai/harness/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/harness-mac-arm64-X.Y.Z.dmg" | head -2
```

Confirm `npm view harness-server version` matches.

---

## Validate a published release

Once the assets are published, run the `validate-a-release` skill
(`.opencode/skills/validate-a-release/SKILL.md`) against the released
mac-arm64 zips before telling anyone the version is safe to roll out: it
boots the released enterprise and cloud binaries through
`packaged-first-launch` (fresh install), checks the updater manifests' sha512,
and verifies signing/notarization.

---

## Notes

- Desktop installer fixes only reach users through a new release.
- AUR publishes by rendering the committed `packaging/aur` template
  (pkgver=0.0.0) in the CI workspace and pushing to aur.archlinux.org — the
  AUR-side commit is that channel's publish protocol; this repo stays
  untouched.
- Native workspace deps must stay converged on one major across all apps —
  electron-builder rebuilds every copy it finds (see #3561/#3563 for the
  three-release outage this caused).
