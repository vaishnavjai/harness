 * CORE JOURNEY: Den's "My Automations" is a monitor, not an authoring surface.
 * The creating surface owns immutable execution placement — Desktop creates
 * Desktop work and Harness Web creates Cloud work — so Den shows what is
 * scheduled and running, links each Automation to the surface that manages
 * it, and keeps exactly one operational control: cancelling an in-flight run.
